When I get them in mail.""Great app...saves me a lot of $...runs a bit slow opening or picking a diff drug but is worth the wait""Very good information""Use the app, not the card.""Easy-to-use, and good pricing information.""It's a good app when it worked right, now when I check on the news and information tab on any drug name,  it says it has to close,  use to work fine. Anyone else have that problem?""Very informative and easy to use. Love It !!!""I picked up a prescription at my local pharmacy. It was $120.00 for a month supply. I downloaded this app and went back to the pharmacy counter. They refunded me the $120.00.  The new charge for the SAME prescription was only $25.00. WOW!""My go-to app for drug price information as well as info on alternative drugs.""I love this app. I can find the lowest price on my medications and stay informed with the news part. Very good app!""This app is awesome! It helped me take $1,300 off of a $1,600 medication. It doesn't require any personal information. All you do is pull up the coupon and show it to your pharmacist. I couldn't recommend it enough.""GoodRX is a great resource, accurate, for all RX info. It is easy to is informative and accurate on the information. Very helpful""if you can't afford your prescriptions this card may help""Good information,  but doesn't show all eligible pharmacies.

I was told from 12 until they turn 16 my chart is pretty much useless for managing their care due to a North Carolina law stating that parents are only allowed limited info about the child's medical information. After they turn 16 they can then get their on my chart account. This app is now a waste of time and useless to me. Wonder if this means I no longer have to pay the bills?? Yes that was sarcasm.""I can't remember my password. How can I get it?""I had to reset my password and it took 20 minutes.""My chart says that I am 289 pounds, I don`t know where they get their information from or if they just make it up as the heaviest I have ever been is 265 and currently at 244.5""I have been using the app for a while and love it. Last couple days the app stopped asking for my pin to login, I have had to enter my password instead and once I am in I try to set the pin and it won't take, the slider for use pin keeps turning off. This is happening for all 3 hospital accounts that I use.""It shows useful information. There is no way to correct things that are incorrect or falsely flagged and can only make appointment with primary doctor, not with specialists. The billing section always has a red alert exclamation mark whether there is a bill due or not, which is a false alert.""The app works well enough, but has very limited functionality compared to the web interface. Unfortunately, the web interface does not have a mobile site and is very, very slow on my phone.""I love this app it's extremely helpful and convenient. I love the vast amount of information about my medical status that I'm able to see just from my phone! It's incredible. I highly recommend this app.""There is only one thing that needs to be fixed. I was proofreading an email to my doctor and hit the back button by accident and lost the whole thing. There should be a box asking am I sure that I want to end this email because now I have to start over again and it took so long for me to write that one. Other than that that app is amazing.""I love MyChart. It helps me with my up coming appointments and medical information.""The app is fine but limited.  Messages/summary from physician appointment do not appear.  The only messages that do appear are notices of appointments.  Login features for fingerprint or 4 digit code don't work.  Not possible to remove medications or care providers that have changed.  Insurance information was updated but doesn't appear in app.  Overall it has  l imited use and I will likely delete this app.""This rating is for mobile app after update. No longer able to place any photos of myself on the app. No longer able to print anything while using the app. Need to print some test results for other doctor appointments. No graph history available.""I am locked out...app has no method of contact for assistance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You cannot communicate with MyChart!!!!!!!!!  No such thing as \"forgot my user name\"!!!!!!!!!!  No such thing as \"forgot my password\"!!!!!!!!!!  ANSOLUTELY USELESS!!!!!!!

Tried reinstalling app, still won't let me log on""Fast and easy to use for appointments, records and billing information""This used to be a great app for information from UCLA.

Said check your address submitted, the site may be either down or maybe the website nolonger exists. Im done, tried for 2weeks and used up my data as well as my time.  On top of that Google asked if they could get me to do a survey and compensate me. After the survey, they conveniently left out the compensation part.

The scheduling options it includes are too limited and default to no sooner than 2 weeks out, so don't bother using it.""The health issues summary upgrade does not list all of my health issues.  I need this information to show all of the health problems.  I use it when I am filling out paperwork for other doctors.""Always available when I need information. I love this app""Would be 5 stars if I could move it to the sd card.""Can't find my UCLA records. Both password and username don't work. HELP! Thanks.""Thanks for telling me my pregnancy is an issue (under health summary). Why isn't my flu shot there? Seems data isn't organized all that well.  Only doctors are listed to contact? I just needed to send over data not ask a question.  Love the idea of this app.  Preferred KP's app.""I like it so far (the website is not mobile friendly, and I like being able to use a pin instead of typing a long password every time).  I can't believe I can't copy text or screenshot a message from my doctor. Really? This is all stuff I could do on a PC or mobile. Not very convenient when I need to share information from my child's doctor with her other caregivers.""I like this app but it has not updated any info since the install.  There is not a sync function. It does nt have a contact emailer.  Please fix it.....""The app has improved some since I first started using it, but it's still lacking in since areas. For instance, you could add in the ability to print out test results or, at the very least, be able to compare current tests with past tests. I feel quite restricted with my inability to utilize my own medical information.""Was great until latest update. Now I cannot get in with my password.""I loved this app BEFORE any updates. Since my last update, I am unable to even get the \"login\" page to open let alone get into my account. Seriously! Fix your \"bugs\" in the app and REALLY FIX these issues!! So NOT happy!!""I have 2 providers that I used to be able to look at and now I get an error. There is no way to contact you through the app. I went to the provider website and reset password and it doesn't work in the app. I need to know how to get in. Also you need a way to contact you through the app.""Great information""Reliable app to keep track of my medical information.""It does not give you all information""Used to work and I loved it.  Now can't access it on mobile app or on desktop.""Constantly tells me it's having problems with the server. Also tells me there are messages that I can't access on the app and that I need to log on with a computer. I downloaded the app because my laptop has a virus that I can't afford to have fixed right now. Other than appointment reminders (which I can rarely access because of server problems), this app is useless!!""This is the most incomprehensible site I have ever encountered.,  You bill me from MyChart account, and when I try to respond you tell me I do not have an account and I should call you?! Makes me wonder if I really owe you money or, indeed, do you owe me some for your incompetence? Tell the Three Stooges at the Epic Systems Corporation to refund NHRMC's money.  Only, of course, if you can contact them. Walt de Vries, Ph.D.""It was great.  Now since they did the upgrade, about 2 weeks ago. My appointments hours have changed within a 3 hours difference. The app says 8am appointment but the doctor's appointment from the offices is really at 9am.  It's so jacked up right now.  I have called epic 4 times, nobody has bothered to get back to me. This is a  horrible app.  Do not download it until they fix the glitch. I have to call every doctor's appointment before I leave in the morning to find out the real appointment time. Because there's several different times listed thanks to this app! \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20""I should of gave you one star \u2606 because everytime I try and log in my account it says \"error, problem with the server,please try again later\" and I have several times and nothing except one time it deactivated my account because I thought I had the wrong password! This time however, I know I have the password correct because the doctors office put me in contact with customer service and she reactivated  my account & put new pw(temporary one) then told me in order to set it up I had to get on a desktop or laptop pc to change it and so I did. I had no problems getting on from the website it's only this app. Also by going to the website just proves that it's not account that it's ya'lls app that's messed up. So can you please fix this? My doctors depend on this to reach me to contact me when they cannot get to me by phone! Thanks in advance. Regards, Margo Susanna Tovar Update: uninstall is evident because I'm having the same problems I had before and you have failed to contact me and tell me something so it's just taking up room so today I'm uninstalling it. Geez I have alot of providers on this app and can only get to one because something about the security. \"Security issues\" before it was something else and it's been months it's missile of November now & still no response from the maker of this app.""Refuses to allow me to use my established password and username.  I don't have time to fool around with this.""I downloaded it thinking I could pay my bill from it to save time.  But it doesn't allow you to pay your bill.  I am not positive but I don't think you can do any other changes to your account either.  It doesn't do what I want so I uninstalled it right away.  Waste of my time.""You need to fix how to login into this app. It offers finger print but does nothing to accept it. Just loops you back to loggining in with the password. Then does not accept the password. Until its fixed i wont be using it.""It supposed to save my login information.  But it doesn't.  And I have to reset all my info every time I try and log in.  I have set the same user name and password each time it says it's wrong.  Also when asked what high school I attended to reset password it also says I'm wrong.  I know where I went to school.  Love the app, well when I can get into it""The app won't let me log on.  Keeps saying to check my log on information.""Can't do anything with the app, but check notifications! Sits there trying to process. No bio information, just a spinning wheel.""There is no place to reset the password on this app. I called Valley Medical Center and they say you need a desktop, many of us don't even own those anymore.""I would like it if I could reset my forgotten password :/""I think this is a very good  source  to have, it keeps you informed.""Mostly Convenient. Needs a few updates to make it perfectly useful.   UI is user friendly.  Main screen has category icons (folders), highlighting a specific option. Very cool option, when clicking on upcoming appt: Can call office, access Map to get directions AND add the appt to you Google or Calengoo Calendars.  Clicking on add to calendar, it automatically adds the Doc, Time, Date and Address. You can edit or save it.  That's just awesome!  I get sensory overload during & after appts.  So adding to or updating my calendar sometimes has to wait until the next day.  Now it's right there, able to add/edit, quickly & easily!  Able to access lab results. Not able to see Radiology tests or results. It's helpful to at least know if the results are ready.  Especially when they're important, you want to speak with the Doctor as soon as possible.  Not able to view a the trend of a specific blood test, that's an option online.  Can't see Doc Notes or Office Visit details (avail online).  Email is great. But, if you are sending an email, there's no verification that it was sent.  (When it's important, you really want to ensure.)  There's no option to check the outgoing email folder. When the doctor replied to my email, my original message was attached.  However, using mychart online, you can access \"sent\" emails. Also, I didn't see the \"e-checkin\" option, for upcoming appts (avail online).  Tried to take a screenshot of my Nephrologists email, so I could show my Neurologist, the plan of care. It said: \"Taking screenshots is not allowed by the app\" (avail online).   Mychart has definitely been useful & mostly convenient, but it needs a few more more updates. Especially when having several specialists, it's an  important tool.  It makes tracking & follow-up easier.  Helps to ensure appts are correct.  Email is useful for communication & sharing with each Specialist, specific Care Plans.   Problems~FYI: Downloaded app twice. Had to factory reset my phone. Mychart was on it prior.   Downloaded the app, after the factory reset, wasn't able to set up a \"4 digit pin\".  Kept saying it wouldn't accept. I gave up, after many tries. When accessing mychart, a few days later, it asked for my 4 digit pin.  So, It did accept, even though it said otherwise.""Great app! I'm hoping full access to \"Notes\" will soon be available on mobile devices. It's difficult for me to get to a computer, which is the only way at present to access this feature. Otherwise, excellent, smart and easy to use app! THANK YOU!""Can't remember password, so glad it remembered for me.""What a joke. Can't login using correct name and password. Why waste time with this junk? Life is too short.""Does  NOT Launch....The app will not accept my known (to myself and to the Internet MyChart version) User Name and Password.  It's worse than useless if I can't activate the blasted app.""This app stinks! Please go back to the last app, FMh. None of my results or records transfered. I need that info! Difficult to navigate and not very personal. I don't like. NORTHEAST GEORGIA MEDICAL""It no longer allows me to schedule appointments. The \"schedule appointment\" button is there, but it just pops up a message that it can't do it. So, I just use the website. Scheduling appointments is one of my most common uses for the site.   It's just as easy to load a browser and log into into the site, where I can actually schedule an appointment, so no point in the app really, except that the app is meant for mobile phones and is thus slightly easier to use (mainly because you don't have to pinch zoom the pages). But I'd rather have all the functions than a slightly better mobile layout.""Very informative""After reading that ridiculously scary EULA, I decided, and with very good reason, NEVER to install this application. For anyone else reading this, if you installed this application, you gave Epic the right to all of the data on your phone, personal or otherwise. They could literally download your wives nude pictures and show them around the office and legally there would be nothing you could do about it, because you accepted that EULA, likely without reading it. They can gather your GPS location data, and the EULA specifically says so. They can take any information they want from your device and use it in any way that they see fit, and you agreed to it the moment you accepted that EULA.""Inconvenient annoyance poorly designed slow and YOU STILL HAVE TO CALL THE OFFICE. Just one more layer BETWEEN doctor and patient""I forgot or don't know my username or password. I'm not even sure if I've made one even. There is no \"forgot password/username\" option or a place to even sign up. Lol what a joke.""This app gives me access to my medical information faster than going through the portal via my laptop. Test results arrive in the app before they do in my email. Very handy when you go to the doctor and want to discuss test results, because you can access all of them on your phone. Highly recommend.""It's OK it won't let me update my new information""This app would benefit by adding an ability to log health related information like home blood pressure, weight, glucose, and symptoms, then make that information available for doctor to see. As it is, I need a separate health log app.""Accepting the terms of this app allows EPIC to use your personal \"user data\" to improve their services  etc .  In the health insurance environment we're in, would you want to allow insurers (or our increasingly alarming federal government)access to your entire MyChart record?  Read them for yourself, but this is how I interpreted, and immediately uninstalled , this app.  Word to the wise!""Very organized and good information""Love it and it's the best app dealing with especially when it comes to one's health, I personally would be loss without the use of it because it so informative when it's come to my health, medicine, test appointment and so much more \ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd17""I like the app if it worked properly. It will not let me get over 26,000. I actually got surprised when it let me get to 28,000 but then I went on it the next time and it took so many points away that I'm back down to 25,000. It takes 3/4 and 500 points away a couple of times it took 900 points away. Frustrated and giving up""No more making calls to get test results. Everything you need you'll find literally at the palm of your hand.  Its easy to read and navigate to get the information needed.""Won't let me log in with my user name and password I used before this update! Can no longer get to my medical records at all. Now it's back to waiting to hear from the doctors office as if they aren't busy enough! Want the old MyChart back please""Can receive my information at any time, any where, I just love it.""I like that the app, it has a lot of good information pertaining to my health and tests I've had done along with my medications and reminders. What's stopping me from giving five stars is that I think the UI is a bit complicated. I'd also like the option to select University Hospitals in Ohio. It's my main provider and SUMMA is my other one, but information about my health is missing due to the former not being an option.""I need a tool I can use.  That means when I have a message or important information on it that I need a copy of to post in messages and calendars and the like that I need that flexibility.  You, in an attempt to protect your precious whatever block those abilities.  I can neither take a screenshot or copy and paste critical information.  I did find one redeeming quality in this area in that calendar entries may be made to my Google calendar.""Works ok most of the time. This app needs fingerprint authentication for those that can use it to make it much easier to hop in and out of the app.""Love this app a lot! I have Crohn's disease, so being able to contact my doctors right away is very helpful. I wish you could copy the text from the messages or take a screenshot. I get the whole security thing, but you already have to enter a pin! I don't want to write word for word what my doctor said just because my mom wants to know what's up.""Great app to interact with your various doctors and retrieving test results. Only wish they would include the clinic address when sending you email appointment reminders. I have missed a couple of appointments because I went to the incorrect clinic.""Seems to work for what it does, but lacks functionality. For instance if you want to enter in a flu shot, you can't. Screens lack navigation - apparently the back button is good enough. Dumb app name. Who looks for \"MyChart\"? Just call it, \"health records\"""Great app! I wish it allowed me the choice/option of screen-shots, or at least an email fwd ability to other Doctors.""can't contact support because I forgot my password. smh""I really like it, makes communicating with providers and reviewing results and plans a breeze - very empowering. I only have 4 stars because messages you send as a patient are not saved, only the messages you receive are, would be outstanding if you add the ability to keep the entire chain and thread of communication, just like any email.""Handy and convenient. I love being able to manage medical apts and records on the go through a mobile app. I would like to see more health care providers use this feature.""The app has both improved and suffered drawbacks.  Improvements: You can delete messages with attachments. Pictures of you medical professionals (please include with name selection in messages and appointnents as thumbnails).  Partial imorovement: Can add appointments to your calendar from the app, now if only they would fix this so it is a full calendar integration.  Fall Back or FAIL: You used to be able to look what times were available abd choose your time slot for making an appointment. It has niw degraded to the point where you are better off calling for an appointment.""

Time and time again NOTHING is listed or available to see. Everything is empty and blank.""Finally I feel in charge of my records. I love that my information is readily available for ME! I can actually see whats going on with me. How my health has improved or gotten worse so that when I visit my Doctor I can say something like... I see that 6-9 months ago my blood pressure or cholesterol levels have decreased and maybe my meds can be decreased or altered. This app really helps me monitor me and let's me know that the doctor's orders have worked and the changes that I have made to myself works. I love monitoring me because sometimes the Doctor's may not see what I see and I can bring it to their attention. GREAT APP!""So far I like It.

It does allow me to email my doctors, which is a plus.""I love all the information that is provided to me. I am happy with how easy this is to use, how I can request for an appointment, send a message to my doctor if need be, and see my prescriptions without having to log in to my pharmacies website. Everything I need is here. The only thing I wish is that my provider was connected so I can pay my bill.""Love this app.  All my information is easy to locate and I love the emails telling me there is updates to my record""I debated on using this .. and once I did .. was like \"WHY did you wait? This app is fantastic !! In today's busy world, it helps a medical staff and you stay in close connection .. not quite like a doctor house call, but it sure is close .. and my doctor's not in the same system .. I simply pull it up once in their office and I'm  able to share information they need as well. I LOVE THIS APP\ud83e\udd17""In todays busy world it makes info, appts and comnunicating with your doctors easier.

I am being told that my password is incorrect. This is a common password so I know it is correct. After several atte.pts I resigned myself to resetting the password.

I no longer have to call and leave messages to the nurse or front desk and have them relaying messages betweem me and the doctor and then wait for a return call. This app is great because I can email with the doctor and much less confusion and way faster.  Can also see any other clinical information that I may need.  Great app , it solves an annoying  problem and makes life a lot easier""This app consistently takes over 5 minutes to load any information. Even after reinstalling and working with tech support to solve the issues, I can't make appointments for my kids through the app. I would say it's a poorly-written application that needs serious work to make it better. Details for each category are seriously lacking. I also use the MyChart app which is far superior in speed and information provided. Unfortunately Sharp Rees-Stealy does not use it.""This app no longer updates information?""Great information also helps you remember your appts""Good information. I like the extra resources available to help understand the test results.""Great app. Very useful and informative!""So convenient to have this information at your fingertips. The app interface is a little annoying to navigate (for example blood test results are each under their own category that you have to open instead of all being compiled on one page). But otherwise it's a wonderful app to access healthcare information.""Awesome app that can help you keep up with your medical condition, medicine, vitals, weight, and so on! Very useful app, contains a lot of information and great to have it at your finger tips.""Great for having information available any time or place!""I love all the information that is available to me at the touch h of a finger.""I do not know if it's my doctors office fault or the app, but my information has not been updated since I joined.

It is truly amazing.""IF, key word IF, you can get in with your credentials then it's pretty legit. But approx 85% of the time I am unable to get in using my credentials. I have saved me credentials /log on information and emailed it to myself for instances like this to see if I have missed something. I have not. So my resort is to press \"forgot password\" which then result in no communication to my email address on file (which receives emails from my providers through the portal) for my \"reset password\" information. I'm highly irritated especially when I need to reach my doctor via email semi urgently as she doesn't have any availability for 1+ months.""    ""com.teladoc.members"":     ""Just had an amazing experience.  Thorough consultation for my spiking fever while taking into account all the mitigating circumstances. Called in a script to the 24hr pharmacy i provided. I definitely recommend. Also had the option to do video call and send pics!""Very fast response, I got a phone call back before I could plug my charger in. I'm very impressed with this and will recommend it to everybody. I got the benefit from work and I think it's the greatest benefit out of all my benefit package.""Thank you Teladoc for cutting ties with the NRA. Until that organization supports research in to gun safety it has no business having a relationship with a healthcare organization. Strong work!""My son was experiencing abdominal pain, his pediatrician was booked for the day. My work promoted using this so I gave it a shot. Couldn't have had a better experience. Onboarding was easy, medical history input was quick enough. Within a few minutes we were video chatting with a doctor. I answered his questions, he saw my son react to me pressing on his belly in the areas he requested. His suggestion of an OTC medication had him back to normal within hours. Will absolutely be using this again in the future.""It works as expected. Its got a nice interface though the devs need to fix how you're automatically logged out, at all. That shouldn't even be a thing.  Newsflash dev team, smart phones aren't passed around like house phones so it's not a security excuse. It's an annoying bug that needs to be fixed""Bad business. Just another way for insurance companies to help their bottom line and provide crappy service""Won't allow me to enter 6 digit birth date to register and set up my account.""All my concerns were handled within an hour, from setting up an account, seeing a dr. Getting diagnosed, being prescribed medication. It was a fraction of the cost for better treatment.""Set up appointment but never received a call from a physician. A rep called back, 2 hours late, and asked if I would be interested in rescheduling. I did and never heard back. Horrible customer service.""I haven't used the appointment feature yet but this app doesn't have a basic function of hitting the back button and closing or prompting you to close. Cmon this is basic stuff.  Updated app as instructed but back button still doesn't close out app. Also we have to create a pin each time we use the app if it logs you out. That's an inconvenient and pointless feature. The whole point of a pin is to avoid putting your password.""Missed 3 calls. They don't tell you to have restricted calls unblocked or that you'll get three attempts when the first call is to verify your identity. $25 for a service that I didn't use and waited 3 hours to find out this nonsense. The customer service rep, said I would be charged for each visit attempt, and had no empathy.. . An email said I wouldn't be charged?!? Going to minuet clinic where I don't wait because you can set an appt online.""very little UI feedback.  Tap on something, nothing at all happens for seconds (e.g., tap on \"not now\" for \"share my location\", not even a graphical change to \"not now\").  Apparently the folks who made this think they know what I want more than I do because when I rotate my tablet their app changes from portrait to landscape (or vice versa), even though my system settings indicate I don't want any rotation. Operation of the system back button is inconsistent. I also expect tapping \"back\" when there is no more history to exit the app, not do nothing. Their service may be phenomenal, but their Android programmers seem lacking.""Used the app with symptoms of a heart attack. Was promised a call within minutes. It's been over half an hour and no call. So they clearly take the needs of their users seriously.""Has decent general info articles and the app itself it easy to use, but I scheduled a visit and did not receive a call at my appointed time, even though I received multiple confirmation emails. Very disappointed""Scheduled a visit and the doctor called me back within 30 minutes. I had a restricted call block which made them go straight to voice mail. Luckily the doctor left me a message saying they would try to call me again twice and if they were unable to speak with me that the visit would be dropped without charges. I rushed and turned off the call block and they returned the call after 15 minutes. The doctor was good and listen to my complaints asked few questions and sent prescriptions to my pharmacy. Could not have asked for anything better. I don't have  time to go to the doctors office. This was convenient and very affordable since my insurance covers it all and I didn't have to pay any co-pay!!!! Thank you Teladoc!!!""Horrible advice given. We called because my 3 year old is showing symptoms of the flu.  My husband has already has a verified flu case from our pcp 7 days ago. The teledoc dr didnt believe it was the flu bc she doesnt have a cough and has only had a fever, runny nose and sore throat for 24 hours. The teledoc dr said our child was considered low risk bc she is 3 years old and not under 2. The CDC considers high risk under 5 but teledoc says they do not follow CDC guildlines, they refer to AAP guidelines instead. For this reason they would not give my daughter a prescription for Tamiflu. Instead they recommended i wait another 24 hours and call back the next day and pay for another visit to possibly get a prescription then.  Fyi tamiflu should be taken ASAP to prevent serious flu complications. The teledoc dr said that while that is true they also do not follow that advice and only recommend it in severe cases bc the side effects outweigh the benefits. Well we went to the PCP, they did a swab that we havent found results on and got our tamiflu just in case. What a rip off and what careless advice from Teledoc. Our PCP said since my husband had the flu and my daughter had every flu symptom except a cough it was a \"no brainer\".""Did two appointments late night. Got call backs within 20 minutes.Script sent to my pharmacy and ready for pick up first thing in the morning. Will recommend and use again. Saved me a lot of money and time sitting in waiting room with other sick people.""Daughter had flu. Call me  back in 10 minutes. They called in prescription. I picked it up with in the hour!!! Great""I received my teladoc membership in the mail today with my teladoc ID but the app won't allow me to create an account. After reading other reviews decided this isn't worth the trouble. Deleted the app and shredded the mailing.""First time using cause my new insurance high deductible I pay 100% of a doctors visit so when my wife woke up sick this morning I thought I would give it a try$40. Set up the account for me and her made an appointment and teladoc called her and after asking symptoms w She was told to see primary care Doctor. Burned for $40 won't do it again and ill defiantly will pass info on to all my co workers""Each time I use this service it is fast and reliable. Used them today and was called back in about 10 mins. I use to go to primary doctor or urgent care clinics.Most of the time this will be my choice!""After waiting for 45 min for a call back. The Dr. said I had all the symptoms of the flu. But since it was 5 days since my symptoms started she said she could not give me a prescription. She said just to wait it out and buy over the counter meds and drink lots of tea with honey. For that I could have just consulted with my mother. Its been 2 days since I called and I still have fever, chills, cough, congestion. I have been sick for 7 days. I am going to my primary care provider tomorrow. This app is a waste of time and people could seriously die following their \"consultation\".   Update: 1-18-18 I would like to respond to the reply. Yes I definitely did not agree with the doctor who \"consulted\" me. The flu is not just something that can be dismissed with home remedies. Many people have died from it in recent weeks.  Doctors should not just take the flu lightly.  I got better results visiting a doctor in person.  I am sorry that your doctors take things like this lightly but people whose loved ones who have died from the flu do not.""Been waiting two hours for a call. I have received 3 notifications that a doctor is reviewing my medical history. If it only took me 2 minutes to create my medical history, why does it take 2 hours to review it? I have read tombs of reviews that have had similar issues with this service. I deleted my payment profile and locked my bank account. I won't have them charging me for doing nothing. I don't care If everyone has the flu. I DO TOO!!! If I could give zero stars, I would. teledoc... YOUR FIRED!""Don't want to pay a real doctor? Use Teladoc and you get to pay $40 to be told to go to a real doc. Or better still, they can call you from a restricted number, tell you they will call you back in 5 min, and just never call back, so you can either roll the dice,again with another $40, or just bite the bullet and go to a real doctor. Least fun roulette ever!""What kind of bs app limit password to 20 characters? Please fix.""I have to agree with other people worse app ever the doctors won't really do anything....i keep trying to reset my password but the link won't work I'm so over teledoc""They are horrible!  I have been waiting 2 days to be called back.  I was told this morning that the doctor tried calling me 3 times and my appointment was cancelled!  That is a LIE!  I do not have any blocks on my phone.  This morning I rescheduled my appointment via video.  They called to ask if I was willing to take a phone call instead and that I would be the next one to receive a call from SC.  Three hours later and no call.  So I called to change back to the video call.  I was called again and guaranteed a call back as the next patient in line.  That was two hours ago!  This same ordeal happened two years ago.  I made an appointment for my son and myself.  I received a call for my son but not for me.  So I cancelled my appointment.  However, they billed me and I had to get that straightened out.  I could have already driven to another state, sat in a doctors office and received care.  I do not recommend Teladoc to anyone, not even animals.  This is ridiculous!""This App is useless can't even login I've tried to reset password get link via email, but still can't login... Il just go to primary doctor.""Today was the second time that I tried to use teladoc to no avail. Last summer I was at a family reunion out in the middle of no where... Off the Grid got bronchitis really bad called teladoc and they said they would call me in an inhaler to the local Walmart where I was and they never did I was out there in the middle of nowhere and I had to wait until I got back home and go to see my doctor before I got any relief and I was out there for 10 days. Today I call them because I have a sinus infection really really bad and because I said I coughed up a little something they refused to help me even though they were going to help me when I have bronchitis last summer I don't know seems a little sketchy what I do know is I've gave them $90 and got nothing in return I will never use teladoc again""The problem is not with the app or the concept but witb the misleading information they provide. Their website says: \"speak to a licensed doctor...in under 10 minutes\" we waited for more than 1 hour. The doctor did see the picture we uploaded and sent prescription but, they should not make such claims if they don't have enough doctors. We are happy with the concept but not with the way is being managed and advertised""Very helpful. I got sick while traveling and my insurance didn't cover any local  doctor. The entire process from making the appointment to the end of the consult was less than an hour despite having a high call volume. The  teledoc physician was professional and  listened to all my concerns and prescribed sufficient medication to treat my symptoms. There are limitations to what they can do of course since it's over the phone. There are also limits on the types of drugs patients can receive. My biggest issue so far was requesting a consult and after an hour I was informed that I would not likely get a consult until the morning. It was in the dead of night though it sort of defeats the claim that you can talk to a Dr. 24/7.""THE WORST!!!!!!! I paid $40 to have a doctor tell me \"go to a local clinic\". I was basically brushed off by the doc whom did not bother to ask where I had pain. I had to start the conversation on my issue. A rep said I would get a call back within 24 hours based on my claim, its been 6 days and still no call. I was denied a refund. Paying someone $40 to tell you to go to a local clinic is ridiculous. This is a joke and a complete scam. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!""Needed a prescription for a scratch on my cornea and doctor denied to call in because they were afraid I wouldn't follow up with a regular doctor.  It was Christmas Eve and the urgent cares weren't open and I couldn't afford the emergency room. I called back to complain and explain I needed something temporarily to relieve burning until after Christmas so I can go to my regular doctor. They said a nurse will call me back to help and of course they never did!  I called back later on in the night and the representative said the nurse never got to look at my case cause they're busy. She also said they couldn't call in a prescription eye drop cause the doctor denied me the first time. They told me I couldn't get a refund cause the doctor talked to me so I pretty much threw away $40.  This company is a BIG WASTE of time and money. Makes sense they are part of my insurance. Crappy doctors/company and crappy insurance!!!!""Keeps logging me out even though I tell it not to and does not recognize my answers to my security questions.""Extremely displeased with the navigation of this app. I simply needed to find my password and it was like I was requesting clearance to the Pentagon. And 10+ minute wait time to speak to a rep. Ridiculous!""Ive had it and I.still dont have my member id.. Ive asked 4 times for.it and they say it's only available in email.. They sent it to 3 email addresses and I haven't received any of them. Id like to have what I paid for""My family and I have used this service a few times already and it has been a godsend. No more waiting for an appointment then getting dressed and driving to an office, waiting for an hour or more to be seen while in misery, the Teladoc doctors called back within minutes. They have been courteous, kind and so very helpful and professional. I googled my first doctor, he was an established doctor in my state with great ratings, not the inexperienced, new doctor I was expecting.  This is a great tool to have for when you aren't able to get in to your regular doctor's, I recommend it highly.""Pc interface is better. App gives white screen many places and won't move after that. Can't use Android back-arrow. No menu button. Swipes do nothing. Only way out is to use Android active apps list and kill teladoc. Also, nothing on this app demands devicememory so it really should be able to be moved to card.""I been using teladoc for a while now I love it they always give me a call back within minutes I'm so glad I don't have to sit 3 hours at the doctor's office""Waited 2 hours for a call back which never happened! Then i phoned and was on hold and told about call volume etc.,and someone will be able to help me in 5 minutes. Sad""No matter how far I am from home, I know I'll get a quick response and help getting back to my normal self.""I keep having to call back to request a note a second time.  I specifically ask for a note for work during the consult and do not receive it and have to call back.""The worst service ever. DO NOT USE THEM. Sign up could not find my insurance information. Then I called and it took 30 mins to sign up due to reading of all the legal notices. Then when I tried to get a doctor I waited 45 mins with my sick child late at night. I gave up but then found you cannot cancel the request for a call. So then I called back and tried to cancel it over the phone. To do that it took 10 minutes of more questions. Never ever ever again.""I called teledoc, and in less than 5 min I received a call back. I gave my symptoms, knowing what I had, the doctor agreed, called in a prescription and I was out the door to my pharmacy. Couldn't have been easier!""Thank you. I was hesitant to call because of some of the reviews posted. I live over 30 minutes from the closest Urgent Care/Primary Care doctors. I have a toddler that I would either have to arrange care for, or take with me (which I definitely do not want to do). It took about 30 minutes to set up the username and to give a medical history (have to do that at any doctor anyways). Within about 10 minutes, the doctor called and asked why I was calling, and listened to my answer.  The doctor agreed with me, and explained it to me instead of sending for tests to confirm the obvious (More time and money saved). Our cell lost signal during the call, and the doctor kindly called back immediately. He even addressed my concerns about the over the counter treatments I have been using, and suggested others that will work better.  I'm so glad that I used teladoc. The best part besides the money and time I just saved, is that I didn't have to worry about picking up (or spreading) any new germs in the urgent care.""Cannot handle password resets within the app. It sends an email, with a link that only opens on the app that doesn't work""Received call back in less than 5 minutes. Explained my pcp was on vacation and just needed meds for a sinus infection. He prescribed a steroid and called it in just a few minutes later. From the time I first submitted my call until I had my meds in hand was less than an hour. Would definitely recommend and will use again for minor issues limited this.""It won't let me change my password. Keeps telling me to try again.""Never again. Tried a couple years ago, waste of time and money. Insurance reduced the cost to $5, thought I'd try again today. If you're reading this...please don't bother with them. Told me I had a virus and to go to the doctor if I wanted an \"accurate diagnosis\". The jerk even disconnected the call without a \"Thank you\" or \"Goodbye\". What a joke. I should have listened to the majority of recent reviews. That's what I get for being optimistic.""Horrible service. Total joke. Kind of like IT. Instead of telling you to turn it off and turn it back on, the only answer for teladoc is \"go to your local doctor or urgent care. \" This on a variety of subjects so far.""Completely pointless. They called after about 40 minutes to say we wouldn't be able to do a video chat so it would be a phone call. First phone call with doc disconnected after about a minute. He called back and then said if my son's symptoms (fever, sore throat, vomiting with known strep exposure) continue for another 5-10 days I should take him to the doctor otherwise don't worry. What parent is going to let a 4 year old run a fever and vomit for a total of 7-12 days? Total waste of time and money.""I have been waiting for a call back for 3 hrs so I called the teledoc number which again was a waste of time so mad""This service is horrible. I am out $5 and now I have to turn elsewhere to actually speak with a doctor that can communicate with me about my issue and what I feel works. This has never been that difficult to handle before and I have used two other services in the past for this very same issue. Not only that, but I am still waiting (30 minutes) for a call back from them after the extremely ruse nurse told me I would \"just have to wait\" for the doctor to call me back. Forget it. Save yourself the grief and spend a little more money on a better service or just go to urgent care. I thoroughly regret using this service and won't be doing so again.""This is about as helpful as asking a friend or diagnosing yourself, except you are being coned into paying your copay. Please, go physically see a real doctor in person. The doctors I have experienced were either rude, or provide general information. Save yourself the time and money.""Password resets are a problem, doctors are often unavailable at odd hours, adding a dependent is awkward and confusing. It is convenient when it works, but that's not ever a sure thing. The last two times I've used it I either had technical issues or a bad diagnosis.""It took a long time for a doctor to get in touch with me and when I did get in contact with one the conversation was helpful but also rushed. Also the app needs a bug fix. It always asks me to set up a pin and fingerprint everytime I log on which is supposed to be a one time thing. That's annoying, but in general I will use them again because it was easy to set up and convient for a quick resolution and busy person like me.""The doctor was concerned about my problem and listened at all I had to say.. I was very pleased with the timely manner he called me back in.. very sufficient!!""I had been a smoker since I was 16 years old and I have been smoking for 20 years my primary care physician was backed up was going to take me two months just to get in I desperately was looking for a way to quit smoking so I remembered teladoc through my insurance company what I thought just maybe they can help they were right on time with their phone call they listened and we're more than happy to write me that prescription for Chantix so that I can begin my journey on becoming smoke-free""Always friendly and always efficient. I have wonderful insurance but this app is a fantastic addition. Doctors normally call back in a reasonable time frame. Only once there was a delay but this is to be expected as I do not rush their patients off the phone. The doctors listen and seem to look after the patients best interest. Yes they well sometimes recommend you see your personal physician as to avoid any misdiagnosis which could be potentially dangerous. For example a simple cough to you can seem to have the potential for pneumonia.  In this case of course they would refer you to your physician. For Me overall it's been as money saver when it comes to my deductible.""It was about 10 minutes from setting up my account to having a diagnosis and Rx on the way.  I recommend this to anyone with a relatively straightforward issue that doesn't want to waste (and money) trying to get into an office or urgent care.  Love it!!""It wont let me make an account""Total rip-off - I had the same experience as other users here. I wrote a synopsis of what was wrong (ear infection) and when the doctor called he stated it was company policy that they cannot prescribe antibiotics and so he couldn't help me. He told me to contact customer service and request a refund. I did immediately and they stated that all payments are final which is a joke. If company policy prevents them from treating or even discussing the issue why should I be charged? This was 'elevated' and I'm supposed to get a call back, but my advice at this point is avoid this waste of time and money.""Totally useless, cannot register. I got a mail saying setup your account today. I tried online as well as on the app. It is not able to find me after entering all the information. Such a waste of time.""Easiest medical service ever. Had a sore throat that I was convinced was strep due to prior history. Set up the account, requested an appointment, attached a picture of the pustules on my tonsils... Got a phone call 5 min later -- 3 minutes after that I had a prescription for an antibiotic called in to the pharmacy of my choice. For basic ailments, Teladoc just became my primary physician(s).""The docs are always so friendly and kind. Call you back quickly and save so much time going to GP.""This service was not helpful... couldn't get a visit scheduled. Tried to request a visit on the app and it wouldn't process. So, I called the toll free number and after being on hold for a while, they were having issues scheduling a visit for me as well.  I was told that something was updating with my provider and they would have to fill out a one time use account profile and charge me $45 (my visit would have only been $30 with my insurance) to complete it with the temporary profile. This is not the kind of service I need when I am already feeling horrible.""I did not like this service at all. I had to wait 3 weeks for the appointment and I specifically wrote that I needed prescription refills from the beginning. When the appointment came she did not write me a prescription at all. She told me to go back to my old therapist instead. What's funny is that my family and I stopped going to that therapist because my mother believed he was out to get her. So thanks a lot. Its interesting because my sister used teladoc first with the SAME EXACT woman and her appointment went well. So thanks for wasting my time and lying to me about your services.""You have to be a member to use it. I'm not affiliated with it and apparently they'll look you up in the system. So not anyone can make an account so this sucks. I really need help but whatever.""I was informed a Doctor was reviewing my history and would call. No one called! I waited and waited and nothing.  There are 2 contact lines and not one rang. Highly disappointed with this service. I had a different teladoc before the health insurance changed the company and they were far more thorough with shorter wait times. Get it together!""I having to go back to school""Can't reset my password on a mobile device because when I click the reset link it opens the app or send me to the Play Store when the app is not installed.""I have used Teladoc two times so far. The first time was great. I received a call in a timely manner, and my prescription was called in promptly. The second time, I set a time to call me. The call was about 20 minutes late. There is a message on my account that I can't open.""Save me time. It help with horrible sinus infection, which brought in cold chills, fever, headache, mucus congestion and cough. Provided a great prescription and text notification with cvs app. I don't know if cvs is connected that way.  Please have this app connected with Samsung health. A lot of important information can be shared there example heart rate, oxigen in bloop spm, sleep time, step per day..""My doctor when I can't (or don't want to) get up to go to the doctor's office.  Quick call backs, I just wish they could prescribe my allergy meds more than a 1 month supply.""I spent just as much time with teladoc as I have at a doctor's office.   I was under the impression that it would be more convenient. I was told I have an upper respiratory infection and given a nose spray. Really? Mucous is green, sinuses are on fire, and coughing. Nose spray?! Then, each time I use the app to access information, it suddenly stops working and then I spend 45 minutes on the phone trying to confirm prescriptions.""I really will like it if it works good with my phone because my phone memory is totally lost you know""Rude people they take your money out of you account and dont even receive a call from doctor and it's alway busy in texas dont use this system fraud""Would not scan my insurance card, then would not complete registration after I manually entered my info.

Which i was able to pick up in no time. Thank you so much for an effective & painless experience.""Easy to use. Called back when they said they would""The person that I spoke to could  barely speak English.  I asked ahead of time if he was authorized to give a doctor's note for work. He said yes and that he would be sending it to my email. I never got the doctors and I have no way of contacting him because he called me from a blocked number and the email was sent through teladoc, so I cannot replay through email ether. I like the idea but it still needs a lot of work. if you are unsatisfied with your care call 1800Teladoc.""This app blows. Most frustrating thing I've done in a while. Then I finally get in touch with a doc and they tell me to call teledoc and won't see my boy. Even though he's on my Aetna account! I want to swear over and over on this review, but I'm afraid it would get flagged. So feel the frustration of this review, and trust me, just call your normal doc. You'll end up doing it anyway, it'll just save you time and frustrstion.""Can't scan in insurance card. Held steady for over 3 minutes""Great experience! And fast call backs!""am very happy with my wife back""Waiting over 1.5 hours, still no Tele doc. Don't use the video call, it's buggy. And they don't  tell you you need Wi-Fi for the video call.

Not happy.""Our insurance covers teladoc, so Instead of spending $50 to go to a germ infested urgent care when you can't get into your primary doctor, or its after hours, a tela doctor just Sends the script to my pharmacy if needed and even email you a doctor's note if you without ever leaving your house!

Waited for a doctor to call back only for him to tell me I would need a exam to make sure that a sinus infection is what it was so to go to the er or urgent care. Which I would've done in the first place if it wasn't advertised on teledoc. Never again this is the second time I've used teledoc in a year only to be told I would need to go in anyway. Hoping my company does away with this.""I had a classic case of the flu and rather than wait in a long line for a doctor to write a prescription, I was able to use Teladoc. I entered my med history, uploaded some photos, and opted for a phone call. Within 5 minutes, I got a call back. And the doctor was straightforward yet nice. Got a prescription sent in to my pharmacy of choice.

He called in everything I needed and the call couldn't have gone more smoothly. If you're not getting a call, odds are good you have restricted calls blocked.""The app closed every time I tried to take a picture with it.

Overall okay but I wish I found something better, also not geared towards anyone but first-time parents. Would not recommend! Especially if you're with a midwife haha.""Best App by far! So much support and daily information! Love it!""Love the information I get and exercise to do threw your pregnancy""Easy to use. Informative.""Very informative and easy to use""Informative""It's very detailed about what happens throughout the pregnancy. A bit intrusive about personal data but overall awesome on keeping me posted on does and don't throughout my pregnancy and how to stay heathy.""I like this app but I wish the articles had information For Canada and the US. Right now the articles are US only but my friends and I are Canadian and the articles aren't always that helpful since our maternity leave and doctors appointments are quite different. Just some small feedback.""Overall I enjoy the options to enter health data, appointments and milestones. Only complaint is the \"what size is baby\" options are not good...some weeks comparisons are smaller than the previous week and each weeks size doesn't seem to match all other sources of comparison. Overall though it's my favorite app to use.""I love it... it helped me so much with my first Pregnancy, and  every information they give me helped. Thanks so much""Very helpful! So much great information in one app! Helped me keep track of everything important! Just what I needed! Love this app!""Its great I love all the information can someone fix the notifications they arent coming in..""Very informative articles, love being able to read about the baby's growth week by week, love the pregnancy video shared each week by Ovid staff, love the options to choose characters/themes!""The only app you need- from a dad to be. Great money saving tips, growth information, and good advice for both parents.""I loved the day by day updates and the informative colorful articles.""Provides daily information about growth of your baby and symptoms to expect. Also gives you plenty of tips for healthy baby development and pregnancy. A must.""Adorable And Informative \ud83d\ude0a""Love this app! Great information! Adorable updates.""I have downloaded so many pregnancy apps and this is by far the best one. It tells you so much information everyday and weekly. You'll absolutely love it.""This is the absolute best for me since it is my first pregnancy! Very informative!""My youngest son is 7 years old so its like im starting all over. The app is very informative. Just wish it viewed towards twin moms such as myself.""I love this app so far. So informative and especially the calendar that tracks my data and allows be to put little notes like when i told family and how much I exercised and what I ate.  I also love the food lookup tool. Has proven very helpful when am not exactly sure about whether I should be eating something. Very handy, indeed.  Recommend""Very informative. A worthy companion especially for first-time pregnant moms. It even shares valuable insights to daddy. \ud83d\ude0a""By far the most informative and helpful app. I have ever used!  I'm pregnant with #3 and still going strong! Lovvvveeee it!!!!""I love it and it is helpful.  Just one thing i would like to change. In the community questions. I would like to see the answers without have to answer myself. I dont know the answers beacuse it is my first pregnancy and dont want to tell anyone wrong. But i would like to see what they say so i could be informed as well.""I love this app, it is the best one out there in my opinion, with all of the helpful articles and food ideas. Also the super easy to understand information on the babys' growth and development. This is my second pregnancy however, with TWINS. And there is no app out there that accommodates to twin pregnancies. Not one that you wouldnt have to pay for anyway. I would LOVE to see a twin pregnancy option.""Love it. So informative""Very informative""Great app. Highly informative.  Recommend""Very informative.   Definitely better than other apps""So informative and supportive""I loved this app, until I had to udate it and it completely deleted my account and everything I had wrote on it is completely gone now -.-""Very helpful and informative.""Very helpful and informational about any questions you have.

If you're a visual person like me than you'll love the pictures of the babies development. I recommend this app you EVERYONE that is pregnant! Thank you so very much Ovia for making fun and understandable!""6th baby- this was my favourite app overall to keep track of data, symptoms, quick reference medical topics and medicines, etc.  Never used the community features.  Loved getting to read about the baby each week and remember my milestones. **The contraction counter was not good as it wasn't possible to delete incorrectly entered contractions.  Used a different app for that and it was more user friendly + more info for that stage.**""Great app. Very informative!""Love how it compares the baby size to fun things not just vegetables. It has more information than other apps \ud83d\udc4d""It is informative most times. Sometime the information comes a day or so late not sure why I guess a glitch in the system.""Fun information to read on everyday and easy to use""I love ovia more than any of the other apps I have tried.

Very informative articles and helpful community forum.""Very informative""Very informative, easy to use app""This was hands down the best app I could find to track important milestones and symptoms while being kept up to date with development information and suggestions relevant to my journey through pregnancy.""cannot track more than 1 pregnancy. it wiped out my data for previous pregnancy:((""Very informative and easy to use. Much better than the apps I used in my other two pregnancies.""Great app. Love all of the information on growing baby.""It was good until it stopped letting me use it. I keep getting 'Login Failed '. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. No luck. Too bad.  Feb 2018: I rec'd an email response to my initial review from Ovia asking about what kind of phone I use, what version etc; basically a troubleshooting email. So replied via email with the requested info and I got nowhere. At this point I think it's fair to say I'm an idiot for continuing to try and use an app which is regularly non functional. I guess it's because I like the idea of the app. It's fun and informative. But only when it works. At least 4-5 times a week when I go to open the app I get the login screen. I try and login but get a \"login failed\" message. So annoying. So many bugs. So not worth it. Do yourself a favour; download a different pregnancy app. Avoid the annoyance and frustration of spending weeks trying to login to a non functional app.  Rant over. Bye Ovia. You suck.""I love this app as a first time mom I think it has so much good information.""Really excellent app - easy to use, helps me feel more informed about my pregnancy and a little more in control of what is going on :)""Amazing ! This is my first pregnancy and i feel so much more informed and at ease with the information and schedule this app offers""Information is very useful.""    ""de.moodpath.android"":     ""The app is so simple to use and only take 30 seconds to log each time. I was able to take the necessary steps toward pinpointing a diagnosis to my mood disorder, very very grateful for this app. very informative to its users as well!""I started using this app 4 days ago. Now it might not be long enough to really feel the effects of it but I nearly took my own life a week ago. Counselling doesn't work for me but this app has helped me look back at my mood changes and pinpoint where it's going wrong. I can't put a finger on what it is that's causing my depression but this app really helps me reflect and helps me to remember that things in one moment may seem a massive issue but after a few hours, it actually wasn't so bad. It works for me! Thank you for this app, I wish I'd have found it sooner.""Very well made, helpful, and informative app.""Great app! Would recommend allowing users to enter data for the day after the fact""Very informative""Your reminder didn't work, and i forgot to do the mood tracking, and then i  didn't have enough data so it says that i have to wait for another 14 days. It's too long.""Great app for those of us who suffer from depression. Just reading about causes and such, although I am aware of most of them, has helped me through some bad depressed episodes. Reading the information validates my thoughts and feelings and helps to pull me upwards, even when it seems impossible. Keeping track of what I'm feeling, along with notes as to what happened during the day allows me to see what may have triggered an episode, which in turn helps to be more realistic in what I think and do.  It also helps those around me to understand what is happening, so they don't judge or feel helpless, and assists them in what they can do to help. Well done.""A great app! Its aesthetic and very clean visuals. The charts and graphs help me accurately track my moods and go back to see why I was feeling that way.  Only a few improvements could be made. During the time where it asks you three questions about your mood, I think having the option to write down a personal response to the question after selecting yes would be beneficial.  And as a few others have said increase the space to write. And possibly question not limited to depression but more general well being. Like how your job friends location and problems affect your mental health. I use this app to locate my triggers and what makes me happy so the more details the better. I plan to use this all year long and probably longer. Really you guys amazing job.""Very good information presented in a way that's easy to understand.""Really helpful and informative""First day on it and I already love it. It has some great information and is well thought out and put together""Easy to use, tracks nicely, gives reminders and suggestions, informative charts and background. Wish it tracked sleep too.""I love this. I have severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD (probably more lol). Mindfulness is important and I love being able to track patterns.  Still in the 2 week data collection phase, so I will update once that's done. But the information provided on background, biology, learned helplessness, and etc is great.  Thankful for this app! I never write reviews either so there ya go lol""I've been using this app 3 times a day, still haven't finished the 2 weeks so haven't gotten results yet. But the additional information is very concise and useful, it really helps understand ins and outs of depression and why you feel that way.""I use this app every day. I print out the doctors letters and use them to slow my doctor exactly how I've been feeling. Great for anyone to track their moods. I wish there was a little more variety to the questions, but what questions they do use are appropriate. Great app!""The information section is easy to understand and informative. The text is also big and paragraphs are small with big spaces between making it easier to read. The questions and the ability to see your progress and acrue more data for a more conclusive look at your depression is very helpful. I think it would be nice to have more questions. The same 10 or so questions get boring after a while. Otherwise this is a really good app. I like it a lot.""It's informative and helps with understand your thought process""I haven't finished my first 2 weeks yet, but I'm excited to see the results. I have a therapy session tomorrow and I think I'll bring this up. I find it a helpful way to document my mental state because by each therapy session when my therapist asks I can't remember entirely. 5/5 so far for sure. Thanks for allowing this app to be free. It's helped me think about my feelings in a deeper way outside of therapy and it makes me feel good to finish with the questions throughout the day. While I may not be accomplishing much else it feels like a pat on the back almost... almost. :]""I love the resources section. The information helped a lot. As for the mood tracking, I would like to be able to edit moods/ answers and add more optional moods because sometimes my mood changes in between the three daily responses. Overall good app!""I really love the idea of the app and the knowledge available for it, however I was ultimately disappointed. I think for some it may be a fantastic choice, but as a person with functioning generalized anxiety disorder and random but sudden bouts of depression, this app failed me.  I really like that it checks in throughout the day, but wish it offered more time as I ended up missing some of the question blocks and doesn't seem to tack on extra events at the end of the two week period to make up for it so you're left with missing data. It also requires an Internet connection, which was problematic as I went out of town and had no reception or Internet and missed several days. I made a mistake in one of my entries and there seemed to be no way to go back to change it. I also wish you could specify the times as my depression hits late at night, long after my last batch of questions for the day. I think the questions should be adjusted slightly, to specify \"currently\" as in, \"are you CURRENTLY feeling like this?\"   I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder with some depression on the side and was advised by my psychiatrist to try to track my mood while we attempt medication. Again, while a great idea in theory, ultimately the app failed me as it says that I'm fine, and as \"normal\" as the rest of society. I know this isn't the case and that I just happen to be high-functioning which is how I got to the point I am at now with random and sudden mood changes which before I had no explanation for. I would always compare myself to others who had deep-rooted depression and, recognizing they had it much worse, made excuses for why I was feeling how I did. But that's what they were. Excuses.  BOTTOM LINE, this app is meant to be a guide and may not work for everyone. There are many forms of anxiety and depression, and if you feel off, sad, or overwhelmed consistently, please see your doctor.""An absolutely fabulous app, lots of information and a very helpful yet non intrusive approach to helping you figure out what you're thinking about and how to deal with what you're going through""It's so helpful as it gives so much information about depression and how to help you""I agree with Rachel Helms. It ultimately told me that there were no indications of a depressive episode. If you truly want to know if you have depression and which type, GO GET TESTED BY PROFESSIONALS. Just because I'm not depressed everyday, THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T HAVE IT. I have Major Depressive Disorder, and I wanted to see if this app would be able to detect it. All it could mostly detect, was pessimism and low self-esteem, with suicidal ideation coming in third place. I wasted two weeks just to be unfortunately proven right - that this app was a waste of time. I don't understand how it's rated highly, either. I couldn't answer one of the evening questions BECAUSE I NEVER GOT A NOTIFICATION. We should be able to go back and answer the damn questions! I don't recommend this app - just go to an actual psychologist.""It looks deserving of five stars, but I whish the knowledge section had information past depression, I wish it'd help me understand some other mental problems that I could actually relate too.""So far informative... I like the tools available within the app. Good job.""A way to correct or add additional information or answer questions you missed would be an improvement.""I like how interactive it is, very informative and I think this will be beneficial after the 14 days days to see what the analysis says when done.""I'm enjoying this app so far, except I just accidentally answered one of the questions wrong and wasn't able to change the answer. I feel like you should be able to go back and change your answer within a certain time frame, as now this will effect my overall outcome.""Contains a lot of helpful information.""I've tried a few different mood apps and this is the best. It does all the work, which helps when your motivation is low at times. Not only does it unobtrusively ask you questions about your mood you get a summary. A doctor's letter and a code for therapist or your Dr to track w you. It has education about depression and coping methods. This is definitely the next generation!""Mental healthcare is hard to access on the NHS in the UK and too expensive for many of us otherwise. This free app is very helpful in tracking your own mental health and lets you export or share the data as needed to show professionals if you get the chance. Honestly fantastic.""Amazing way more information than planned, worth the time""Just starting it now. The amount of information in this app is impressive. I'll revisit this review later on.""I like how this app gives awareness and information about ones feelings. It helps me feel better being able to chart my mood and have easy access to resources.""Great app! Informative and easy to use... just wish the daily notifications worked at the time i set them... I always have to open the app to start each new tests everyday""Super helpful! Gave me a lot of information and gave me insight into what i might be dealing with. This app is amazin.""This app is just what I needed. It gives me all the symptoms of depression amd other things that can be mistaken for depression. It also gives ideas for treatment and how to get help. I'm glad to have come accross this during a low point in my life. The information is very helpful even to me as a nurse. This is a great app.""It is a great app for tracking depression, but is missing some useful features. It would be great if I could keep notes of changes in my medication there as well, maybe also some sort of input field to summarize my doctor's views from the monthly visits. Also - why on earth is it not available in 'my country'? I have to use my Norwegian credit card to download the app, and so I cannot share it with some others in my country who would otherwise have benefited from it greatly.""Really useful app. Great to see an app that actually tracks mood, but also gives in depth information in regards to mental health. Well presented and easy to use. Love it!""Really useful t o find out information I've only been using the tracker for a little while but as am information app alone. It's well presented and really interesting.  I really think the format of questions is good too""This app makes my heart so happy. To see that information like this is becomming more and more available to general public is making it possible for the mental health stigma to lessen, mental awareness increase and allows for people who struggle with mental health issues to feel normalized and validated in their experiences. The app ran well for me and provided me a great deal of insight into depression. Thank you for all the work you've put in and I highly reccomend this app to anyone seeking insight into their mental health.""Really good information. Its cool to see how your mood changes throughout the day and can give you insight on how to make those times better.""its great because it is confidential and informative as well as interactive""Interesting! Easy to use and informative""I am on day 3. Very simple yet informative.""Terrible, I had to restart the survey twice and it STILL never gave me my answer. All the questions are repetitive and OBVIOUS indicators of depression. If you get tired easily, have little to no appetite, and often feel sad or empty: you're depressed. But this app doesn't care, if you're depressed this app won't help you, it will only waste 15 days of your life, and an additional 15 day for every day you skip (because if you miss one day, you have to start all over again from the beginning, which is ridiculous). In conclusion, this app is a waste of time and data, seek ACTUAL help if you believe you are depressed""It's such a good app for expressing moods that you cannot regularly tell others like family without being talked back or judged.""SOOOO much potential, but the data entry interface is literally THE most broken, counter-intuitive, game-breaking design I have EVER encountered. Such a shameful waste of opportunity. Booooh!!!""Provides incorrect drug information. Could be very harmful to some users. Example: Alprazolam is Xanax NOT TAFIL. And Lorazepam is Ativan, NOT TAVOR. Please educate on correct drug information for the safety of the users.""Easy, Informative and Relaxing First time, and not a bunch of paperwork!""As phones become increasingly available to people all around the world, it's apps like MoodPath that will help us lead healthy lives by bringing mood awareness to ourselves and analyze how it impacts our health on a regular basis.   Use this app on a regular basis and, after some time if you are being honest and forth coming with your daily assessments, you will start to notice trends in your mood and behavior. You will also be made aware of people, situations, or concepts that significantly alter your mood.   What you do with the information is up to you, but in the very least you'll have learned a great deal of things about yourself that you either didn't know or hide too well from yourself that it rarely surfaces.""Useful information in the \"Knowledge\" section. Also this app helps you to realize, be mindful of your current state.""It's a brilliant idea, it just has several bugs that need to be worked out. The notifications are extrodinarily inconsistent and a couple of times it has actually recorded my input on the wrong day. I love the idea and may look back to this app in the future after everything is smoothed out, but for now I have decided to download a different mood tracking app that is more consistent, even though it doesn't offer the same depression geared prompts that I so adore.""Moodpath is a great app with a very clean, appealing interface and easy navigation. The information provided about depression is very user friendly but also detailed and evidence based. I found that the fortnightly doctors letter summaries are very accurate and have an impressive level of detail given the yes/no format of questions. Overall I am very impressed, love this app and will recommend to others. Thanks Moodpath!""This app was pretty great for mood tracking up until the bugs made it impossible to use. It really puts things in perspective and makes me realise the positives surrounding me even when the moment feels negative. That said, it would prompt me to respond to questions, then never open the questions up. I hated having one or two time periods X-ed out because I couldn't go back and add in my mood after the app malfunctioned. Now I keep getting an error message saying \"No Internet Access\" even when my 4G is strong or I'm connected to WiFi. I'm locked out of the app now and will be uninstalling.""I like the idea of this app and really wanted to use it but it is wayyy to buggy.  Alerts seemed infrequent (but maybe I just didn't notice them?) But when I did click on an alert that new questions were available 9 times out of 10 it wouldn't load the questions and there seemed to be no way to get them to appear.  When I first started the app it kept on reasking me the same first question and acting as if I was just setting up an account.  Last straw is it now keeps on showing an error saying I have no internet access which I assure you I do. Not worth the hassle.""The app froze after asking me to accept the Data Policy. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times over the course of three days. It keeps freezing, so I just gave up. I can't use this app at all.""This app is very informative and amazing. I especially love that you can write about how you're feeling in the notes part and all mood progressions charts :) But there are a few bugs which is why I'm giving this app 4 stars. I did two phases and still no doctors letter. And sometimes I miss the time to answer questions, I think it'd be great if we had an option to adjust the times to fit our schedules etc. Because some people are busy.""I appreciated when the app opened up a chat window to ask me if I was okay after selecting Yes for \"thinking about death\". I was asked if I wanted to be connected with a help-line (is that the proper term?) and was respected when selecting \"No Thanks\" and was given contact numbers in case I changed my mind. Most sites or apps or even some PEOPLE wouldn't care to that extent or know to offer that kind of help in that same situation. I am giving this app a rating of 4 Stars since I agree with some that there should be an option to change your mood in case of accidental selection, and also to have it optional to add more moods than just the manditory 3 per day. I think this would offer more information for the sake of the results and for the user to see how much change throughout the day has occured. Thank you for creating this app and thank you for caring about \"us.\"""Since an update, or Android update mine is either not prompting me or missing the questions completely. Today it gave me the question but then notified me and took me back to the path. Was awesome before""It's a good app, although sometimes when it alerts me that new questions are available, it does not prompt me to answer questions when I open the app. This has caused me to miss several questions so far. Also, I think that it would be better if we could track our mood throughout the day, not just three times. Some people's moods can change rapidly, and I feel it would be more accurate if we could give more information per day.""Have only used the app for about a week and it has been very insightful and informative. There's a lot of helpful information, they take a mood tracker and bring it to a higher bar""Informative and helpful""So far,  it's  becoming very i informative.... though i do let days go by and forget to touch base with the app, i can already tell that if i try and keep  up...this app can improve mental health on a way. Its completely  relatable and thats what  makes it so interesting .""Really well thought out app! I love the idea of mood tracking through questions. Unfortunately, I had some issues in the knowledge section where it would randomly have some questions/information in German. I would also say that the information provided is at a fairly advanced level of reading/understanding. If you're unfamiliar with college level psychology or biology concepts, it could be challenging to get through. Regardless, I will definitely be recommending this app to others!""I was really enjoying your app until...I noticed a huge inaccuracy. It has to do with ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). Because of severe depression, and PTSD, I was subjected to that horrible \"treatment\". That was around 6-7-8? years ago, I can't remember. It drastically damaged my short term memory. I had actually forgotten I had even had ECT, until a Facebook memory showed up, talking about it.  My long term is still pretty good, but my short term continues to be horrible! Please don't say it has no long term memory effects, that might encourage people to try it. One of the worst decisions of my life!! Please rethink, and more accurately describe ECT, in your lessons. Thank you! PS. It did absolutely nothing to help my Depression or PTSD.""Very informative""It's only been a day, but so far i like it! However, i do wish i could add to entries, or edit things. For instance, i filled out Nov. 1 entry last night at 1:00 am, but it registered as the night entry and I cannot record for the morning and afternoon of Nov. 1st now. If that makes sense. Otherwise, so far so good. I hope this helps me to track my mood more easily than other apps with way too many options or features. I also like the informational aspect.  Update: everything is great. The only issue i have is that the reminder is not attention-grabbing enough, so i often miss a morning or afternoon entry, since there is a limited time period to fill out of. The option of full screen reminders or something of the short, might make it less easy to neglect accidently. However, i haven't missed a while day a single time. I'm looking forward to the feedback i will get from the doctor's letter, etc. Once the survey period ends. I hope the app tensions helpful after that time, and that i can keep a record of each survey period to compare over time""Very informative. I am on day one and interested in how the results turn out.""Helpful, could be a few more questions and a note section (like online diary part). I've also emailed some other suggestion but it's really good and I definitely recommend it to anyone even if they don't have a mental illness, it's just so easy to keep track of and to do.""Just started it today but so far I'm really liking it! The information section is very informative and has really helped me to understand some of things that have been going on with me!""Nice app that asks to track your mood 3 times a day. The result after 2 weeks were not so detailed. I tried it again while trying to choose extreme values for my answers then the report in the next 2 weeks was more expressive. Nice app and has useful information to read.""    ""com.doctorondemand.android.patient"":     ""Great assistance to help you get back to healthy!""Frustrating app to deal with. Couldnt use my hsa card. Kept sending me in circles. A pain  to  deal with when you're  sick.""This was such a great service! My Dr.'s office is backed up big time right now, with all the sicknesses going around! They are able to evaluate my symptoms and prescribed my antibiotics! I can start feeling better within a few days now!!!""Great service in this busy world.""Dr Gibbs id's very laid back and easy to talk to""This app has been a godsend. I have used it twice,both times I received competent caring Drs Who gave correct diagnoses. I will be continuing to use this service. I am immune compromised so a lot of the times I go into a doctor I end up coming out with somebody else's sickness so this allows me from the comfort of my own home to see a doctor. Thank you so much for creating this app.""Doctor I met with was very patient and explained and answered all of my questions.  Took ten minutes between the time I installed the app and had registered my account to my appointment.""A very positive experience my appointment was on time my doctor was well informed by going through my chart and I felt very comfortable and excellent way of helping people that don't need to go outside when they're very very sick it was very good experience I would have no problem referring it to any of my friends""the phone interface is really crappy as is the   laptop internet interface. did not want to load another app on my phone but they disallow using their web interface. definately not a good user experience. long, long wait times for the doctor and for customer service, deceptive appt times, cut offs occurring during the visit, being overcharged to call back to diconnect... etc. the doctors have all been great thus far, no complaint there.""Complete scam. They schedule fake appointments and then when it comes to your appointment so it suddenly \"fails to connect\". They then say they will call you back and they never do then charge your insurance for a no-show. Been on hold for 35 min to resolve this, still haven't spoken to anyone. SCAM""The app was easy to use and the doctor call was quick. Unfortunately even though they said my prescription was sent to the pharmacy it never arrived. I've emailed several times and waited 45 and 60 minutes on hold for their customer service who both said they'll get it sent over. It's been 9 hours since my doctor call. Still no prescription. Now that I'm done working for the day I'll have to pay to go to a Minute Clinic since I need to start the medication today.""Charged my card 3x. No response from anyone. Totally unacceptable""The app is excellent! I'm really grateful for such a cool tool. The only thing I wish is that there was a way we could have the contact information for the doctor in case there's technical issues with a visit an we can simply reschedule.""Ecellent care, professional and courteous. Dr. Li was very informative.""Okay I'm changing my review. I did have a prompt Dr's consult within minutes of my initial request,... however...they called in my prescription to the wrong pharmacy and I exchanged several emails with them in a timely manner but thru my own investigation \"I\" found out it was the wrong pharmacy. I searched Walgreens pharmacy on their app and I knew there was only one Walgreens on this particular street but it listed the wrong pharmacy. I called customer services asking them to transfer it. Thinking they had done so properly, I called the pharmacy and waited on the line for 25  minutes only to find out there was no prescription on file. I called back to Dr on Demand customer services to ask when they called to transfer it and she said they called but left it on the  answering machine. I had been waiting from 8 pm till almost midnight,...I called them again asked them to please, please speak with an actual person so I could receive my antibiotic. It's past midnight and I still don't have my prescription since it was just phoned in. I'm steaming mad!!!!! This didn't save me anytime and ended up being more of a hassle! I do not recommend them!!!!!""This company sucks. We scheduled an appointment for 4:45 p.m. At 5:00 pm the system tells us that the Doctor is still busy but might call before 7pm that evenimg. 4 hours later the system says we have been charged $75.00 on our credit card and NO CALL. App does not allow you to reschedule once you are in the que""Tried this app, schedule an appointment, paid the fee, when I saw the doctor she told me to go see a doctor in person. I emailed that I had strep throat before I paid and they told me it was fine, as long as I took pictures and send them. I took the pictures and uploaded them. Doctor said she'd need to run a strep test and so she couldn't help me. I feel like I got ripped off. That was exactly why I asked ahead of time.""Easy way to quickly get back on the road to recovery.""Had an asthma attack and needed a refill. Dr.Oh was able to get me a prescription within the hour. Great Service, fast , and a life saver. I Totally recommend this service.""doctor couldn't help and told me multiple times i wouldn't be charged I WAS! tried emailing them no response. now disputing the charge through my bank. ONE STAR""We had a medical emergency.  Time was of the essence and antibiotics prescibed by the doctor.  It took 24 hours and many calls for staff to get the prescription over to the pharmacy.  Patient was shamed and spoken rudely to.  Emails were acknowledge received on the phone after not being answered. They have lots of people in need of prescriptions and we were wasting their time.  Very rude staff that are angry they have to do their job.  I am very disapointed and angry.  Twenty four hours can mean and abscessed toothe infection can get out of control.   Be up front on the time frame so we know not to use you. Multiple promises of an hour timeline were never met.  Shamefull behavior for medical staff.""I have used this app several times as it is an option through my employers health insurance. Not only does it save us money because it costs no copay, it is easy to get a doctor appointment right when you need it from the convenience of your home. All of the doctors have been very thorough and able to prescribe me medication to my home Pharmacy at the end of the visit when needed. No need to go to a waiting room and be exposed to other patients who may be contagious, sit in a busy Urgent Care. I love this app and hope it becomes more popular so that people who would have otherwise avoided going to the doctor seek out Medical Care earlier or even at all when they would not have otherwise. The doctors seem to be a very good quality I have never had one that I was uncomfortable with either the thoroughness or the quality of the tele exam or presentation of the doctor. I am in the healthcare industry and have the ability to assess Drs. I was skeptical at first but now after using the app several times for both myself and my family I am very happy we have this option I strongly encourage people to try it out""Scam - my doctor told me if my bronchitis got worse to call back, didn't mention this would cost me an additional $25 just to complete my first visit. The doctor was great this app is about money not patient care now I am going to go to a doctor's office and start all over thanks for taking my money.""Great service for those of us who need behavioral healthcare but can't face an inperson visit. Very positive experience.  I will be back.""After going to an urgent care facility learning that my out-of- pocket portion would be $250, I was very discouraged.  Then my friend suggested the virtual clinic.  The doctor was eager to answer all my questions and made me feel as if I was right there in the office.  Great service! Did I mention that the visit was only$40? I'll be back in the future.""The Future of Medicine!  The app is intuitive, the doctors are great and it is so convenient.  If your employer or insurance participate, download this app now.  You can pre-enter personal and payment information so it's super convenient.""Very helpful for busy adults wanting to avoid flu infested waiting rooms""    ""com.easymobs.pregnancy"":     ""Love this it's very informative and easy to navigate""Needed information at the needful times.Good app""Very informative and supportive""So informative, I love this app!""Great app!

This app is extremely informative & so enjoyable !""I love this app! This app helped me a lot through my whole pregnacy journey physically and emotionally, as compared to other pregnacy apps.   It provides just the information I needed without being naggy-draggy.   Strongly recommend the kegel exercise  tool within the app!

Very nice app!!""Great app with lots of information and interactive parts. I like that I can view my pregnancy weeks on a calendar - really useful when arranging appointments etc. Only thing this app could do with is a widget so you could track movements without having to go into the app - a touch of a button would make life that little bit easier.""Full of information.

I love seeing how the baby is growing and understanding the process. Very informative. It even encourages you to do kegals and provides a timer to help you. There's a weight tracker and a good journal option for those interested but you don't HAVE to use it.  They thought of everything. Must try.""Excellent app with easy to read small chunks of helpful information""Great app and information. I love it""Consistent & Informative!""Helpful. I love reading the daily progress of my baby.

Very informative""It's got lots of information just really enjoy this app""    ""com.wellpoint.consumer.ABCBS"":     ""It works fine for me. It does the digital card, I can look at my claims, etc. And if you know your plan, you don't even have to log in to find a provider.  Only thing I don't like is the scroll when trying to select provider type or something like that but that is a pretty minor gripe. Works fine on a 5 year old Android.""Basically worthless for me to use, I hate this app almost as much as I hate the mobile platform""This app is useless.  I can only log in, search for providers, and view my card.  What happened to being able to view my EOBs or deductible/out of pocket expenses?? App takes a long time to load in between pages as well.  Doesn't have any of the features I actually want in a healthcare app.""I just found out that Medicare BCBS members cannot use the mobile app.  This is very disappointing as I do not own a PC and have difficulties viewing my account in desktop mode on my phone.  I pay for my insurance so it would make sense that I should be able to use the app.""No fingerprint login, nor auto fill via Google. Keep forgetting password. App is crappy so many ways. Plus non existent customer service.""This app is terrible. I can only access my card. The other services are always \"unavailable\" or broken. I contacted the developers and never heard back. Its been this way since shortly after I downloaded it. I might as well just keep a copy of my card downloaded on my phone. Very disappointing and useless app. Interesting how it's #10 on \"Top Free Medical\". Wonder how much it cost to buy that title.""Useless. Takes too long to load and doesn't give much information other than looking at your id card & doc search. Better off using website with browser in desktop mode when you need something that doesn't show in mobile view. 0 stars for app if I could!!""Neither this or the website work on mobile""Can't log in 90% of the time. Mobile website searching for doctors and urgent care doesn't work and you can't view your medical card because \"something went wrong\". Useless app.""App is broken, the menus all show pretty much the same thing, not the information that is advertised, and repeatedly crashes""I have never been able to register my account. It always says, \"Sorry, something went wrong.\" I have tried multiple times over the last few weeks and the same thing happens.""The app does not let me pull up my ID card. I have tried multiple times on different days.""Doesn't have my ID card. Unsure of it's purpose if I can't use it as my ID card.""It can't even work. It is legitimately useless, unless you like staring at a loading screen forever. Because that's what I want to look at, not my insurance information.""Can't pay my bill, even though the info claims you can. There is no link to it, only my ID card (which isn't loading) and finding doctors. This is pretty much useless.""Works fine for me. I can pull up my insurance card. I don't really need anything else.""After sending me an email with a confirmation code, it does not allow me to register mentioning the info doesn't match. Funny !!!""never have been able to get my Id card to load....not oncr""The update gave you less accses to your information.""It's useless. Not working properly and I can't even view my i.d. card. Very bad experience.""It doesn't explain anything at all. No doctor info, bill info, nothing. I have screen shots on how stupid this app is with information. It says it found me, than its saying sorry, we are having trouble. Garbage""Useless app, can't do anything useful with it like check claims. Tells you to go to the website instead, but when using mobile it automatically takes you to the limited menu again""Every time I try to access my id card, it says, \"something went wrong.\" Additionally, it won't allow me to access ANY claim information - it just indicates that I have no claims on file for the past year (not true given 8 months of prenatal care and childbirth 2 months ago). I also cannot access any information (including the id card and claims) for my dependent. This app stinks. When I tried to submit my feedback on the app, it also said \"something went wrong\" and did not sub.it my feedback. Guess they aren't too keen on wanting to know how to improve this horrible app.""Useless! It won't load! I decided to see how long it would take and after 5 minutes I stopped it. Since I don't have a computer to use their site and I couldn't log in through the mobile site the tech told me to download this app. It was just a waste of time. I'm deleting it from my phone.""No ability to look at claim info.  Almost all providers want a copy of ID card so that function is almost worthless.  Very little information compared to what is available on website.""It won't let me pull up my ID card""It doesn't work. At all. Unable to see ID cards, unable to see caregiver options, \"unable to process\" on everything.""Terrible app.  Can't even get s simple task like displaying ID card right.  Keeps saying something went wrong and that they need time to fix it.  Useless garbage.""Won't show my ID card or many of the other features accessed from the main screen. Called them about a different issue but let them know the app wasn't working. Guys said he would pass this information along. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it didn't help.""Stuck on the loading screen.. I can't even register or put in any of my information that took FOREVER to receive.""I installed the app and logged right in using Anthem login creds. I backed out and logged in again NP. Checked member card and had no issues so far.""I hope getting coverage is easier than getting an insurance card.""This app used to work fine.  Unfortunately, today I showed up for an appointment and was told that they no longer accepted my insurance - so I immediately went to my app to double check this \"fact\", but the Care & Cost Finder section was not working!  It only showed the statement that \"information could not be retrieved at this time\".  So I had to accept the lady's word for it at the clinic.  Come to find out later (after logging onto Anthem's site) that my insurance IS in fact still accepted at this site.  If only the app had worked, I could have proceeded to meet with my doctor.  So frustrating!""Can't see my card, only the coverage and profile screens which don't contain any information, app is pointless""Able to register but can't input communication preferences or ensure the profile information is correct and up to date. Only thing available to do on the app is look for doctor.""Useless app. After registering and set up. Anytime I tap ANYTHING in the app, \"Something went wrong, please give us time to fix it.\" Can not even see my ID card anywhere.""I am able to see my card but that is it.  Anything else I get a message that says it is not available at this time. The app needs a lot of work because it is basically useless.""Only half of it opened up I hope we can get our id cards""Never opened, not worth the hassle. Real cards on the way anyway. Don't waste your time""Could not view card and when I selected account setting it would spin then say sorry could not connect, try again later.""Worthless.... doesn't provide any real information!""I see many people saying the app won't open, it opened just fine for me on 12-15-2017. I got my new card in the mail, it said to register so I did. I got the app for convenience.   I logged in to my account no problem. I don't know what issues you people are having or why, and I have an $80.00 StraightTalk Anroid phone from Wal-Mart, nothing fancy.   Either they fixed the app or you guys have phone problems.""Anthem... Seriously, what the heck is the garbage?!? The app doesn't even open and you still fail to send ID cards to me and other documents. YOU ARE WORTHLESS and should be allowed to FAIL!!!""I can't open this app.  They need to go back to the drawing board.  This app is awful.  You all need to fix this.""Won't open. Support email address listed goes nowhere.""Absolutely useless. Can't access any real information. There used to be a good app. I dunno what happened""Spinning circle of dots for eternity. Pretty sad, I was really looking forward being able to just have my card on my phone.""Should have known the app is slow won't open. It's as bad as the desktop version.""Mobile access to Anthem is a joke. 9 times out of 10 I can't login, and it tells me to call a number for help. If I wanted to call, I'd call to start with.""I get an email telling me to install this app.  The code they send me doesn't work, I tried again later and it tells me the code is expired.  BS is right""I have been trying for weeks to see my ID card through this app (as it stated it would do) and it just doesn't work.  attempting to contact support also results in a broken contacts website as well.  Stick to the standard ID cards, don't opt in for the digital versions.""Won't let me log in even when tech support gave me a new password.""Slow! Not given enough information like website. Need fingerprint log in.""Will not show me my card. The only reason I downloaded it.""Really!? I was advised by someone at Anthem to register online because communication would be easier. However, the dang thing doesn't even work! I registered and got a confirmation email, but just like almost everyone else it just pops up a number to call \ud83d\ude21""I literally only have this for the mobile ID card and that isn't available any more. What a bad move, Anthem.""It says it will show your id card and that we can send messages, but it does not offer that. Also even on the website it won't show my info. Waste of time.""Garbage. Won't allow me to log in despite using correct login credentials. Installed this by suggestion of tech support when I ran into the same problem using the mobile site - correct login credentials, but then I get a popup saying \"We're here to help!\" and it gives a number to call staffed full of people who clearly cannot help. Acknowledging the popup just returns you to the login screen. Tried multiple browsers with multiple different configurations - same issue. Fix your junk Anthem. Won't be installing this again.""I cannot log in on the app, but can log in online. I need the app so that my children can access the card if needed.""Terrible App, every time you tap on an option it just sends you back to the log in screen. Junk.""They make this app look easy but it's complicated and it's your information and you can't even access it""I loaded this app and it performed the functions as expected. The capabilties are not as comprehensive as online, but good for a mobile app.""Can log in on website, but can't on app. Hoping my password wasn't just hacked. A non-functional app doesn't seem secure.""F@&k u, anthem. Breached our information and not able to log in even I got a email that I request for reset my password.  Charge ridiculously expensive premium.  Can't you get it? They all out of business with that sh$&ty attitude in these days.""A billion dollar company that can't get their mobile app to actually work is pathetic in my view""Never able to pull up a mobile ID card. Always \"something went wrong\"""App is not supported by anthem,they don't have mobile  Friendly server,they tell you to use a laptop or pc to register.""Cannot review my child's information my benefit coverage is not listed anywhere to show me what services are covered or not""Downloaded this to get insurance cards because Anthem did not send them in a timely manner. Yet, you NEED an identification number from your ID card to even register for the app. This was a waste of my time.""Card""I downloaded this app specifically for the ability to view my ID card.  The app didn't have that feature enabled but it specifically says in the description that you can.  I uninstalled the app after that.""Can't even register an account gives an error""If I could give this zero stars I would. Why can't I pay my bill on this? This is a pointless app. Also, the stupid mobile site is the same and no matter what I do, I can't pay my bill on that either. I tried requesting a desktop site and it still doesn't work. You would think that they could spend some some of their profits on a decent app.""When I couldn't remember my password I tried to reset it. Ut asked for my DOB. Fine. I was only allowed to enter it using a drop down calendar that would only allow me to enter year by pressing back button one minth at a time. It started in January 2016. I'm 52...I gave up.""I Just downloaded  this App. Let me Create and sign on to my account. I can see all my approved claims and details. It also supplies me with my card just incase I dont jave it on my person. great app NO complaints !!""You would think a big company like this would be on top of things but they are not. I have tried registering an account via this app and get absolutely no where. I get nothing but a message saying something isn't working with no other help. The help tips for some of the field are confusing and unclear. This app represents how the company as a whole works.""Not able to sign in to my account using this app. Just get the message that my account is not set up to use on mobile. Called for technical help, but they wanted to change my password so they could take over my account to troubleshoot. No thanks""If there was an option lower than one star... It would still be too high. Absolutely worthless. I can't even sign in. All I get is an error message: sorry, something went wrong, try again later. How much later? A few months? Years? It's been weeks and I still can't get in. IT is just as worthless as the app. Don't waste your time, data or storage downloading this trash.""It's a basic app, that's the only reason I only give it 4 stars. Otherwise it provides the basic information on the insurance and allows me to submit payments and check claims. I wish they had the ability to alert my phone to messages in my inbox and when my payments are due, rather than send me a email. But otherwise I've had very few issues, only a couple bugs several months ago; after an update, they were fixed. EDIT: After reviewing people's comments, I will add that a tutorial would be nice. An insurance representative walked me through the app over the phone after I had to update incorrect date of information, and then created my login for me. So I forgot that there wasn't a tutorial. But I still leave it at 4 stars for my experience. However, it is obvious Anthem needs to put more in the development of their app.""I don't understand why people are having such a hard time. I just made my account with anthem and I found my card, my claims list, and was able to use the care and cost finder without any problems. It was super easy and helpful. I also went to the anthem website and learned about my insurance plan through interactive tutorials which was extremely helpful. Thanks anthem!""So how do I view my ID card? How do u do ANYTHING this is supposed to do? Estimating costs reports \"Sorry, looks like something isn't writing.\" Lastly, why is this app so laggy?""This app is awful!  I can never get to the things I need to see and when it's so difficult to get to the non mobile site. Terrible. I'd much rather just have the regular website.""The Android app is almost worthless. Most of the time when you try to look at something you get an error message that \"something went wrong\". Claim information comes up blank more often than not. When you try to search for a doctor and enter a zip code it keeps changing what was entered to a zip code in another state.  No way to ser ID card through app...why? In this day and age mobile apps are an important and convenient  part of managing and keeping track of things such as medical.  This app frustrates me to a great extent!!!""Useless - claims you can check benefits and deductables, but nothing ... Even messages are empty even though I just received one per email ...""I've not had problems others have had. App works well, can login fine, and it has the information it says it will. Without being able to open a claim to see the details (what was actually charged, what was paid, etc) or get any detailed coverage benefits makes it less useful than the website.""This app provides no real useful information. Having just switched from Cigna I thought I would be able to view my HSA balance, claims status, and where I was in terms of meeting my deductible.  Not a chance I could do any of that. Unfortunately, the website is not much better.  I really expected more and hope to see improvements in the very near future.""This a good application to remember your payment history and ID card in case you lost it or left it at home.""Aaarrrggghhh Like all things Blue, self-uninterpretable.  When I finally got in, and fought to get information, it was long past being helpful.  Like returning a call to a Blue Cross nurse.""This app is terrible.  Between this app and always being sent to the mobile version of the website (Which is basically the app in the internet browser) with no option to switch to desktop view,  trying to get account info through phone is a nightmare.  You'd think a company with such outrageous premiums could at least have a decent website and app.""This app sucks... you can only find doctors, it doesn't show any of your information (ID cards,  benefits or deductible) uninstalling...""am i going crazy or was there a place on this app where you could view diagnoses? etc? i rlly rlly want that back!""Always calling Customer service to change my password...even when they change it it doesnt let me sign in...worst app ever""UPDATE 4/11/17, 4:59pm. ANTHEM BC/BS DOESN'T ALLOW ELDERLY and DISABLED to use APP to access their account. I called again yesterday determined to get someone who could enable my account to use the app. I was connected to technical support. As on Monday, I was connected with a representative whose first language was not English. After telling her I lived in Ohio and spoke very little Spanish and asking her to please talk more slowly or communication difficulty disappeared. After explaining the issue she asked which plan I was on. I'm disabled and on Medicare. I chose an excellent Anthem Medicaid Advantage Plan and told her which one. I was stunned when she told me, point blank, MEDICARE MEMBERS AREN'T ALLOWED TO USE THE APP.  Incredulous, I repeated back what I thought I had heard her say: \"are you telling me that ANTHEM DOES NOT ALLOW MEDICARE MEMBERS TO USE THE APP to access our accounts?\" She responded affirmatively. I've also been unable to access my account via their secure mobile web site and asked if there was a connection. Again, she responded affirmatively. I expressed shock that a company the size of Anthem would discriminate against their elderly and disabled members at which point, in a businesslike voice, she asked if there was anything else she could help me with. There wasn't. I'm still reeling. Because of my disability I sometimes go for up to a week unable to sit or stand for a meaningful length of time. I have an app on my phone to remotely retrieve files on my computer. I'm able to shop, visit with family, access my children's school website and resources for their homework assignments, and pay my bills, all from my phone, using apps or mobile web sites. It blows my mind that Anthem would prohibit an entire segment of their membership who, like me, need the ease and flexibility an app provides even more than the general population. In 2016, the most recent year I could find reliable figures for, Anthem had 410,000 Medicare enrollees in Medicare Advantage Plans such as mine, and another 150,000 enrollees in other plans (Medicare Drug Plans, Supplement, or Gap insurance). That's 560,000 DISABLED and ELDERLY forbidden the convenience of the Anthem Anywhere App. More than half a million people! Wth? How many of those reviewers who complained about not being able to login are being blocked because they are on Medicare? | Original Review &gt; No Access. No Use. No Support. I'm very disappointed that an entity as established and profitable as Anthem BC/BS (85 billion in revenue FY 2016) hasn't paid for the development of an app that REALLY DOES allow their members to manage their account in the ways they describe. It appears that even among the few who are able to log on, that rich feature set isn't available. My personal experience? Repeatedly, using two updates, countless fresh installs and one device reset and fresh install, all using verified correct credentials I am unable to log in. I receive a dialog box stating that: \"Your account isn't set up to access our secure mobile experience. Contact member services using the phone number on your ID card.\" I did that on a Sunday evening and was assured by a representative that setting up that access was simple but I had to call back M-F/9am-5pm. Did that this morning. Representative stated that was done by web support staff & gave me new number. That representative, who speaks English as a second language and was at times impossible to understand, even after I asked her repeatedly (I was embarrassed by the number of times, actually) said no \"special access\" was needed and labeled my issue a tech problem. She wanted to run me through troubleshooting I'd already done. She gave me an email address to send screen shots to. Will be doing that today. Not holding out much hope.""Can't get anthing transnational from it, like my card or insight on my deductible consumption, etc...""It seems like every time I try to use this app, I can't log in. I have to go through the process of calling customer service because for whatever reason, it won't let me change a password without their help. Then, their customer service person is difficult to understand. She asked me 5 times if I'm using my phone to log in. I told her 5 times that I was. She said sometimes the mobile app doesn't work. That's brilliant!""I needed access to my ID card and in no way does it display this on the app.   There's no benefit information either.""ID card doesn't work. I sent an email of the screen shot of the message I get when I try to pull up my ID card. That was sent 3 weeks ago, and it still doesn't work. POS app. Don't install.""Wont let me log in even after resetting password with their help desk""I often cant see my claims, particularly my dental. Also, there is no benefit information besides my in/out of network ded.""I absolutely hate this app.....I used to use the older version of it two you my ID card but that no longer works.... and you also can't go to their website to try to view it because it just directs you back to the app""This is nothing more than a doctor finder. You can't look at benefits or research what prescriptions may be covered. The screen shots showing your card, offering refill options, etc are fake because none of that is actually in this app. There is really no benefit to this app whatsoever. Uninstalling.""Garbage.  Swiping doesn't work properly. Information is not rich enough to make decisions. It seems to be geared towards describing your coverage and what is available to you in the barest possible terms. It's awful.""Worst app in history even blocks you out of the anthem website can't get away from it no matter what I do directs you back to worthless app""This app can pull up my card and find a list of unrated providers.... Other than that it's a waste of storage space.""Just like others have mentioned.... it finds my account then refuses to recognize the login.  Onboarding users has to be seamless otherwise adoption rate is terrible.  This app has failed that mission.""I can't see my ID cards""This app sucks. Half of the links don't work. Can't access my id card or other services that I need.""Wow, this app is horrendous. It asks for permissions that it doesn't need and doesn't work used, my in so card is absent half the time. Useless app. Seems like this app was managed by old people.""Been trying sign on won't recognize me after I've reset the password...""After reading reviews I still gave it a try.  Can't view claims.  I did find that going to Google in my mobile browser, selecting \"request desktop site\" under options, then opening the anthem page I could view my claims and have access to the full site I had on the desktop.  Why they can't do that on an app is anyone's guess.""Where did the claim history go?  You can't even look up past claims anymore.  So this is an app to see your benefit card and see your benefit balance?""Sluggish, can't view any claims. Not very useful unless want to view your ID card""Very slow and impractical. Not enough search options and does not refresh the map so you have to constantly put the name or the zip code of the area you are looking for. Have a headache on top of the headache i already have. \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21""Unless you need your insurance card, the app is useless. It doesn't show any recent claims or any coverage information. Have you met your deductible? If something covered? You have no clue.""Would not let me log in. Complete waste of time. Never call customer service anywhere if I can avoid it; those call centers are always outsourced to the 3rd world and you have to have the representative repeat themselves over and over(and I know his name is not Steve, damnit!). Website is slow, but a much better alternative. Unfortunately I'm stuck with anthem, it's what work offers...""Couldn't get past the security questions when signing up""Unable to get detailed information on claims. Pages very slow to load.""Can't view ID card and the company has not mailed out my physical card. I'm sick and need proof of insurance!!!!""Tried searching for the nearest urgent care given my current location and came back with no results. Not reliable if you need to quickly find for the nearest place""It changed my user name so I had to get it sent to me by email. That helped me and now I can log it. I know I was putting everything in right to""Not working on Android 7.xx on a Galaxy S7E - reset password option not working either. Let's see the next iteration with a confirmation note in the change log please!""I like that I am able to view my card, find doctors and price medications.""Don't let u log on. Freezes all the time. I can't tell u how many times it has made me change my password.""Pretty much the only good thing about this app is the ability to see and share your ID card. You can't see any EOBs which is the main reason I use the website.""For an app from a professional company - as opposed to something cooked up by a high school kid learning to program Android - this is impressively bad. As a professional app developer, if I put something like this in the market, I ought to be fired.   It was a struggle to even log on. Most of the time keypresses were lost. Even the back button's usual function seemed to be disabled. Once you finally get in, if you can, the information there is minimal. Change preferences and they don't show up. Even a survey dialog asking for feedback is messed up, because it asks for your email address and the text entry for it is white text on a white background, and you can't see what you are typing!  The only way this app could have gotten any five star reviews, I think, is if people were paid to gove them.""Very little information, when you can get anything to come up.""As crappie as their website. Every time I try to login it cannot find my account. Last time I was on the phone with \"tech support\" for.over an hour, it let me in that one time and now once again it cannot find info. Open enrollment I will probably get different coverage.""Ive had the app for a little over 2 weeks now. It has worked about 2% of the time. I always get an error message when trying to sign in saying \"something went wrong please cal blah blah\".  I also was never able to \"view my card\" with the same error message. Now, it looks like the feature is completely taken away. Whats the point in having the app if you cant have the convenience of having your insurance card visible at the touch of a button? Whats the point in having the app if it doesnt work? I was very excited to download since my insurance catds have \"been sent out\" 3 times but have never acyually made it to me. BCBS, whats going on? Hopefully its fixed/updated very soon so i can actually make use of the app.""Every time you update the app if loses my stored password. Please fix this.""This app is horrible tried to setup a login and password and it tells my oops something is wrong but won't say what so it can be fixed. The Apps as bad as the insurance company is.""No claim information, all you get is a message saying something went wrong and let them work on it. If I worked as slowly as your technical support team did I would be out of a job.""Won't let me register login or anything called the IT guy when the area code for the phone number of the IT department it was told to wait for an update. And to use a computer till it was fixed I was in my truck so that was not going to happen thanks!!!""App has issues. Can't view id card. App closes due to unknown errors. Website also can't view id card.""This app is basically useless. There is very little helpful info or accessible information. Everything I've ever needed to access was on the full website. Very disappointing.""I totally hate this app! What is the use of having an app that you can't use while traveling with a mobile device. I downloaded it then you can't sign-in. Then I call tech support and they tell me that it sometimes doesn't work so use your desk top! Really like I take my desk top around with me. Please! Please! Fix this App Asap""This app is useless. I can see my ins card and that is it. Your it dept is bad.  The money this company makes should have one of the best team of developers""This app does not work when searching for my claims. I had all filters checked and it still tells me i have no claims. I've had nothing but problems online and on this app. But then again I've always had problems with them paying medical claims, problems accessing claim information and problems with customer service. I have to ask myself with so many issues why should this app be any different than the company? It's just Anthem BCBS. It's just how they operate.""I am not sure if they fixed the login issue so many seemed to be having but I have had no issues logging in. I gave 4 stars though because I am unable to see my mobile ID cards via the app. The primary reason I downloaded this app is to view my cards since I have not received them in the mail yet.**UPDATE: They fixed all issues and app works perfectly!!!""I can't use the app or the website to do anything. Won't even let me log in. I can't get an insurance card mailed and I can't even print one from their site. I should have never left my previous insurance provider. When I call I sit on hold for minimum 2 hours.""only things it's good for is the I d cards since they haven't mailed mine out""None of my data shows. Uses the wrong phone number.""The only thing that this is good for is allowing me to see my insurance card. Whenever I attempt to view the details of a claim, it says \"Oops, that didn't work.\" Hasn't worked for at least a year and I doubt that it's going to get fixed any time soon...""I can log onto the site via laptop but not via the app. Every time I enter my password, its points me to customer service! Was in a jam a needed to pull my card up via mobile. I missed an appointment because of this sorry excuse of an app.""I can't log into this app. It only prompts me to call the help line. The authentication seems to be broken. I was excited to see what the app can do, but it was a letdown.""Still haven't received my ID card in the mail so I figured accessing my card online for now would be a good option. I went to log in, but I got a pop up that says we're here to help! And gives me a help number to call. This is very disappointing. Fix please!""Anthem is making So Much Money from us so why can't they update their systems and Call you Back in you line of que like so many other companies do instead of making us wait on the phone for ever. It is bad enough but you have to listen to the same muzak over and over. Your customer service is as bad as Comcast and that is saying a lot. I had to wait for an hour and seven min last night and then talked to someone for about 5 seconds and she put me on hold and You Guessed It I got Disconnected. What a waste of my time. Clearly a waste of money.""At a time when everyone would love this app to work while waiting for insurance cards in the mail, this is a big dissapointment. After registering, zero functionality.""This app is fantastic. Needed my card for the pharmacy, boom! This is as easy and handy as my pay app. \ud83d\udc98 The app is very cool and fast to access. Love it.""I originally gave this app a poor review,  saying that it didn't let you see your card, well that was true for the first log in. After the second login my card was there and options for finding doctors as well. So when you first sign in, sign out, then sign back in.""Logged in to my account once. Then it has never worked since. What a pile of useless data""Can't log onto says error call the number you call number it says wait time is 45 mins keep getting emails now that says bill is due but done paid it twice!!!!""Just like everyone else, I can't log in. It also sucks that the website on a pc isn't working well either. Its been two and a half weeks and I haven't even received my insurance card. So with no card, no app, and no way to access my online card I can't go to the doctor or get my scripts because they need to scan my new card to access my insurance stuff.""NO NEED TO CARRY CARD ANYMORE""I tried to register, and the app said I already had an account. So I went to the password reset and entered exactly the same information. The app said it couldn't find me. As an app developer myself, I would like to think that I would be fired if I produced crap like this.""App does not login with username and password used to login successfully on PC.  When I supply my name, account information it says I have an account but login fails and I am directed to call customer service.  I will uninstall this app until the login issue is resolved.""Since there are so many issues and can't write all of them here. Here a few most bothering ones: 1) Login takes around 1 or 2 mins and that too if I'm lucky. Most of the times it just times out and shows a message asking me to call customer service between 8 AM to 8 PM. 2) When I try to view my ID card, the primary member ID card shows up as blank and says intentionally left blank. 3) The dependent ID cards show up only half of the front side and the back side looks OK. 4) screen switch takes lot of time""My ID card numbers changed 3 months ago, but not in this app. I have sent multiple messages with no response and the ID card showing on this app remains the expired one.  Not reliable when ID card is changed.""I had no problems downloading this app nor logging in. All the information  I need is right there. This app is very user friendly.""Can't use this app tho figure out anything about your account""It asks for a stupid password but never gives you anywhere to build it poorly thought out""Update 12/15/2016: confirmed by tech support today. there is a known issue with login using the App. DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE APP. TRYING TO LOGIN VIA THIS CRAPPY APP WILL LOCK YOUR ACCOUNT.  if there was a rating for minus 10 you will get it for this app. You lied on your Q&A about using the same credentials on your mobile device as the one you use on the desktop. My credentials which I used as early as yesterday do t work on the mobile browser or this app for that matter.""This  app does not have a payment button I have  not been able to make a payment go back to original site. When you call you are on hold forever""I downloaded so I wouldn't have to carry my insurance card. Every time I need my card info, the user profile section that has my insurance info is NOT working!  Every time! I have to end up calling customer service while I am at a doctor's office.""I downloaded this app. just a short moment ago and ran into all sorts of issues when trying to access my profile or any information.  I guess everyone who posted unsatisfactory comments were right after. It's Really a shame.  Anthem, please review the complaints and resolve these issues.  We would like to take advantage of this tool, but if it is unusable, no one benefits!!""This app, and their mobile site, are awful.""Barely functions, when it does it is ridiculously slow. Pretty lame that a giant company like this can't put together a usable app for their clients.""Why when I open the app can I only get the option to find a Dr.  The description of this said I can access my cards but there's no way to do this""Love it. So convenient!!! No longer have to carry twenty cards in my wallet for the entire family.  Well done Team Anthem!!!""Terrible app! I use my cell phone for nearly everything because I am busy and is more convenient... I HATE that neither the app nor the website  (which WILL NOT allow you too see anything other than the mobile version even when you request to)  allow you to pay your bill online.   I have to either call in our drag out my laptop to pay.  Very inconvenient""2nd try. 2nd app downloaded. Still no ID card.""It's ridiculous that this app is identical to the mobile web version (so why have it) and neither of them allow you to pay online. The full website on a PC does, but requesting the full site on a mobile browser just gives you the same mobile site but zoomed out. Uninstalling.""The whole purpose of a mobile app is CONVENIENCE..and you cant even pay your bill on it!! Uninstalling.""I want to view account information, billing, approvals. I don't understand what this app really has to offer...""I really like the UI improvements, but it's true that the functionality is lacking. About the only thing it's good for is always having your insurance card on you. So make the app more robust and I'll up my rating.""Slow. Sorting doesn't work. Search results on map don't show up correct. This just what I found by using few minutes. Not sure what else I find when I actually need it....... Look at Blue Shield CA app far better.""I can access my I'd card, claims, benefits etc all with the ease of my phone.""Can't even log in!  My username and password have not changed but your useless app won't accept it.   Worthless piece of crap!""Useless, crashes, logs out randomly. Never has any information only frequently asked questions. It worked about a year ago. Whatever you did undo it.""I'm at the Dr. Office and the app won't pull up my ID card, and as far as I can tell, there is no other way to see my member number.""Been trying to use it for several weeks now, and it won't let me in. The usual problem of error message when I try to log in. Then error message when to change password, but lets me know I do have an account when I try to register.  Had to take snapshot of error message and send it to tech support. Hopefully they'll fix it soon!! (Worked on laptop.)""Downloaded this app because my work uses Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida and I've been trying to find out my balance for my flex spend account that I didn't realize I had but need to use before the year's end.... Well this app is so unstable I can't keep it running more than two minutes, the info I *can* access is basic and not what I'm looking for, and when I click the in-app link to load the website, it directs me to a page that shows the user and pass I used on the app to sign in is invalid. AWFUL.""App is useful for getting the information I need like ID cards, Claims, Benefits and more.""The app has a friendly interface but doesn't provide any useful information. I'd like to see my claims and EOBs.""Unable to view my ID cards""The primary reason I use this app is to look up claim info and that functionality has been removed. Why? Put it back please!""Unable to get any information from the first day I downloaded app all I get is try at a later time""Most of the information isn't there. Either blank screen or \"Oops, something went wrong.\"""I created an account online and then downloaded this app using same login info. Worked fine. Found my ID card. Graphics are good but sub menus don't scroll on android, e.g. doctor specialty search.""It's hard to navigate, doesn't link all accounts well and was better the way it was.""Anthem mentioned I should install to always have access to my ID cards - but I don't get the same menu items show in the sample images.  I don't get access to my ID cards - only access to my medical records.  Boo!""Log on is a joke ...cant get in ..refuses passwords that it sent. Info of family members is under wrong member. They need to be sued to get them to correct this piece of s***""Overall great app, except I have never been able to view my insurance card. Whenever I click on it, it just says, oops there's a problem, give us time to fix it.""    ""com.zocdoc.android"":     ""Appointment not showing for until changing reason for visit, then switching back to the original visit. Otherwise great. Recommend adding Outlook calendar for appointment reminders.""I cannot access my account on the phone as it refuses to let me change my password. Keeps saying its timed out. Its frustrating and shouldn't be that hard. Why doesn't zocdoc send your appt details in the confirmation as soon you make the appt? I am disabling.""Poor card scan & policy lookup.  Photo comes out blurry on LG v20. Could not find plan under manual listing. Uninstalled app. Already have an app from the insurer that does the same thing.""I left honest feedback for a Dr. It wasn't good. I received an email asking me to revise my review because it didn't meet their terms of use! It wouldn't let me  schedule another  appointment until I changed my feedback to 5 stars for the Dr.....what kind of policy is that!""All ok now with password change. Did it through the website and it worked there.""It is quick and easy to find a doctor in-network. I have not been able to secure a booked appointment yet (Looking for a new doctor). However it does at least get you close to finding someone in your area as well as read the profiles of each Dr.""Missing some really basic functionality. I've had to put in my insurance info ten times. Got locked out of my account for no reason. Super annoying.""The password resetting within the app failed me multiple times. I had to go through the website for it to work.""Absolutely TERRIBLE!!! Scheduled a very important appointment and NONE of my information was even sent to the doctor's office at all!!!""It's Sunday. An ongoing, chronic condition I've never looked into due to expense fears flares up big time and the camel's back finally breaks. I want - I NEED - to book an appointment and finally put an end to something I've dealt with since childhood... but it's Sunday. Offices are closed. What to do?   Turn to zocdoc. A local clinic had it integrated into their site and it turned what promised to be a daunting trip through the looking glass into a stroll through a pleasantly autumn-tinged park. For someone that has never quite faced the perils of finding a healthcare provider or booking schedules, zocdoc made it easy to locate and schedule an appointment with the doctor that I needed. Entirely recommend it for those who, like me, tend to hate the run-around of trying to do things over the phone.""Everytime I put in a Zip code the wrong state in or town comes up...sighhhhh !!!! n I know for a fact there is dentist that take my insurance in my Zip code....n also yes I'm doing it correctly""Zocdoc helped me find a qualified, highly-rated health care professional to meet my needs. Making an appointment is easy with reminders and export to your calendar. You can also securely transmit your insurance information to the providers office.""The doctors never have my information or even that i booked an appt.""Good for reviews but has some fatal flaws. I would suggest not using the app to book. Apparently Drs can't delete Zocdoc appts from their end if they need to reschedule so I've been asked a few times to delete appts myself. Cancel too often and account is deleted.""I've used ZocDoc many times to look for healthcare providers for over a year. Through here I found my dentist whom I would not give up for anyone else.   It turns out that was a one hit wonder. In searching for a primary care physician, every appointment I made here was not recognized by the office and I had to reschedule every time. I understand that there's accountability on both ends in that regard.   Most recently I made an appointment with Dr. Victoria Hoffman in Lafayette, CA, as her office came up listed on ZocDoc under my insurance. Turns out they weren't in my network and now I'm stuck paying the full amount of the services I received.   Moral of the story is, this app tries to make the search process fun and intuitive (which kind of does), but what you actually receive is hardly100% accurate.   I'm sticking to my network's app and website from now on. Though boring and convoluted, at least I'm getting more accurate results.""I like the functionality of the app, but it didn't have the right information. Zocdoc showed a doctor with an available appointment for today. The actual office calls and says 2 weeks. Where's the convenience in that?""Can't save both health and dental insurance info which makes using this app extremely painful. Same with new insurance card scanner - saves only one but Cigna has separate dental. If the first problem was fixed this app would get a 5.""Do NOT rely on Zocdoc. I made an appointment for my mom through the app. When she arrived to her appointment his receptionist said that the doctor was not in that day and did not take my mothers insurance. I even uploaded the insurance card pics for verification beforehand. She said they dislike using Zocdoc because they will push the appt through just so they can get paid and spends the majority of the time calling back patients who booked to cancel. Unfortunately we had an old phone number and could not be reached before we showed up.""Its a glorified doctor searching mechanism. The following functionality doesnt even work: booking appointments (says to update, but I have the latest version) and insurance card uploading fails everytime. Additionally, the reviews seem to be bolstered with numerous anonymous/questionable 5 star ratings to keep doctors' scores higher.""Never books an appointment so slow""It isn't kept up to date on which doctors accept specific types of insurance. It will say that my specific insurance is accepted, then every appointment I make gets cancelled because they don't accept my insurance. Come on people, it's not that flipping hard to keep that sort of information up to date. Otherwise, it would be a most awesome app...""This made finding a doctor within my network so easy.  I made an appointment and filled out new patient information already.  I'm all set for my first appointment.  Thanks! I had a hard time finding a gyno within my network before this. Easy to use with a decent database.""Easy to navigate and very informative....Thank you..""The app is a breeze to use. Only problem - it's oh, so slow. Takes a few tic tocs to load. I'll give it 5 stars with a speed increase. The doctor search should include a hospital search. Users may like the option of choosing a doctor affiliated with a certain hospital.""Very easy to set an appointment, you can check in all your information and save time with the doctor. Im more than satisfied with this!!!""No longer requests account discovery.""Cant never find in my immediate location according to my zip code. Or my health insurance. All out of service.  Stop listing areas way out of my zone. My gosh. Im in need of help and you're not helping.""After having several bad experiences with uh hum quacks, one almost killing me now I do my research. Have used this app to find a few specialists. I read the reviews and make a well informed decision. Great doctors. Excellent app!""Ever since i downloaded this app  (I PROMISE! !) It has really been a nightmare.  They sell your information to 3rd party TELEMARKETING  companies who literally call you non  stop throughout the day! ! One of the companies called me 15 times in one day asking if anyone in my family has blood clots. .. the worst part of all is I actually schedule an appointment to be seen on Thursday October 27th to be seen by doctor in Hemet called Dr. Niab I go and he's not even there worst application ever""Extremely Informative!""Large selection of doctors. Information gathered is nothing you wouldn't provide if you were in the office.""Not all of the insurance information is correct but this is a very useful and easy to use tool! I had to cancel an appointment when I found a doctor I booked with actually didn't take my insurance and the company gave me an Amazon gift card as a gift for the discrepancy. Pretty neat.""This app is very helpful in making appointments especially if you are busy during office hours. I have had some issues with the appointment that I book not being available, but this is rare.""    ""com.hp.pregnancy.lite"":     ""I love this app way more informative than other apps especially ones you would think would be more helpful. No matter how many apps I try I keep coming back to this one. Keep up the good work!""Informative with bite size, stage appropriate info.""It's so helpful application and it has a precious information for every pregnancy stage""Helpful and very informative""Very helpful..  A lot of information for preggy mom like me. Tq\ud83d\ude0a""Super informative and easy to use.never had any issues with app. Would highly recommend.""I have been using this app since I first found I was pregnant and I am due in 4 days and this app has given all the information that I would have trouble finding on the internet I would highly recommend it to any women that is pregnant this app is definitely worth it's money I would definitely buy this app on an apple product.""I really enjoyed this app, untill it wouldnt let me look at most of the information and pictures about the week that i was on. Once it hit week 16 i have to pay to use most of the app (upgrade)  \ud83d\ude2f""All usefull information at the right time love it especially being a 1st time mum and 1st pregnancy""This is very useful app. I feel this app is designed in such a way that it supports the expectant mothers with all the information available. It's like consistent companion for first time moms who are in rollercoaster facing  all the UPS and downs. Really appreciate it""Dissapointed in the fact that it doesn't inform you from the beginning that you need to pay in order to view the weekly info after the 14th week...  Later Edit: Yes, I've noticed that don't worry...but in the Buy Now page you have a checklist with everything you get after buying the app and weekly info is not mentioned there. Maybe you should add that too...also notice that all negative reviews are based on this little thing that you 'forgot' to add...all the best!""I used this app back in 2015 for my 1st pregancy and I loved it. Definately worth paying for. Now 36weeks pregnant with my 2nd baby I've used it again and still loving it. Many thanks to the creators of this app!""Its FANTASTIC! I have had this app with now both my children and it has really helped with my first to see what bub looks like each week. She gets more and more excited. Plus the information in the app is fantastic. Definitely five stars.""Contacted them when i switched phones and never heard back. Their faqs say if you switch from apple to android or vice versa you have to pay again. Nothing helpful on the app anyways to double pay.""It was great for the 13 weeks didn't realize. It was paid app after that. I was sad caise the articles were so informative for me and my partber.""I purchased the premium package in order to get informations on the 2nd and 3rd trimester,I got charged but didn't get the service..I'm very disappointed""Worth the money. Very informative""I love the vivid pictures and the information""Very helpful and very informative""Very informative! Really like this a App""Why would you charge parents money for this information when you know they are about to have a child?! Petty.""I don't usually buy apps, but I decided to this time And I am not dissapointed! Its fantastic for keeping me up to date on my baby, keeping me organised with appointments and helping me understand a bit more with useful information!   Thanks heaps!""I tried out several other apps before I found this, and I love it. It has nice pictures, good information and everything stays within an ethical boundary- I've seen other apps that have quite the nasty discussion boards and photos to give pregnant women the creeps. The only thing I'd like it to have is to have a calendar to see on what date is what week of pregnancy.""I used this for my 1st pregnancy and liked it, but this time it keeps resetting & losing all my data every time, so frustrating, it's done it about 4 times in just a few weeks now... i can't work out why or how to stop it from doing it again!""Very Informative!""It's a good app until they stop giving you information and you have to pay $4 to get any more info""In order to use most of the functions, you must pay to upgrade, but it's totally with it. A lot of good information, easy to use.""Very informative""lovely app with helpful information""I love this app. Im pregnant with my second child and this app. is very informative""A must have during pregnancy! Very informative and excellent format""This app works really well in my iphone. But when I change to android, I have to buy the premium once again? And all my data is lost. I have to start again. I thought when I already have an account, I do not need to purchase the premium again. Hmm""As a first time Mom, this app was very informative and useful!""I used it when I was pregnant with my first, it was very helpful and informative.""Very thorough, great pictures and good information.""i have to pay to use this application, while there's 10000 other applications for free and in the same time informative and useful""Very informative""Awesome app that both my husband and I utilized our entire pregnancy. It was very helpful and informative.""Very informative. Reminders are wonderful. Tracking is great. And the support tools were a huge help. So happy I downloaded this app from the start.""At first I didn't want to pay but once I did I really enjoy this app it's very informative and I love going on every day to something new""I use this app daily throughout both of my pregnancies.  Love athe information and tracking features""I used for first child and Im back to use for my second one :)""The best pregnancy app ever! Very detailed and informative for day by day and month to month progress and tracker. Love it!""Very informative and easy to digest. Love all the little features of the app as well as the daily and weekly updates on the growth of your baby!""The app has two sides to it: the wonderful and joyous guide that explains and informs you with stories, pictures and metaphors. The other side of the coin is the annoying and naggy moral supervisor presuming to know what I'm not doing and should be doing, like: telling me to get more involved in the pregnancy, talk to my wife more, go buy stuff that I am not, stop being a poor partner overall. It simply assumes I'm a lazy and inconsiderate partner and I need to care. I could really do without relationship advise presuming I'm a bad husband. Why did the author feel the need? It's the same week after week too, it's not just a single post, it's literally every week about how poor men are as partners. This is a pregnancy app, not couples counseling!""Extremely informative.""Love the information provided.""Very helpful and informative apps""Used this app from week 8 until the end of my wife's pregancy, very helpful and informative.""Helpful & informative""Very useful information. I enjoyed it up to the 14th week. However, it wasn't good enough to spend $3.99.  Thank you.""Best apps, provide best guide for mothers and good information and tracking about the baby.""Helpful and informative""Easy to use, fun and informative. Full of useful articles that are relevant to your stage of pregnancy. Really enjoyed reading the weekly updates on the development of the baby, your body and advice fir partners - my partner and I really looked forward to reading this together on the weekend. Excellent support in preparing for labour, such as packing a hospital bag and great features to make it personal by being able to log things like your weight and bump pictures.""Have great information...enjoy n fun..nice""I've used this app for two of my pregnancies, and it's by far my favorite.

So much information!""Loving it. Great informative and helpful articles. Love the display of both animated images, 2D and 3D scans from every week. Great app. \ud83d\ude42""    ""com.polkadoc.ocp"":     ""Best app in the world. Life saver. The doctors are more than happy to help you and they appreciate your business. Something I don't see a lot of. I am a returning customer, always""Love this app. Super easy interface and the Doctor responds promptly and is easy to talk to. If you have any questions or concerns it's super easy to get in touch with someone and get the information you  need. The app makes me feel like my information is safe and I love that.""Fast, really simple, very friendly and I will definitely be using it again!! They are just wounderful people, I'm so happy I found it and it's totally legit and secure""I hesitated at first but it was easy, comfortable, no stress, fast, responsive, informative, and honestly saved me so much time. A very helpful and positive experience.""The whole appointment took less than 10 minutes and Dr. Bhat was great!  So much faster and cheaper than trying to go to my PCP.  *The only birth control app I've found that works in Maryland. *Plenty of pharmacies to choose from.  *Knowledgeable  doctors that help you make informed decisions.""Tried LEMONAID first time today and got FIRST CLASS service !!!!   There are a number of other company's that offer similar services but I found this company better than the others.   First, the price is very good. Everybody always considers what is the cost. At $25.00  for the consultation and your treatment is an exceptional price. I worked in the medical field for a number of years so I recognize how good a deal this is. If you don't believe that just check the other services.   This is an exceptional deal!   The next important thing to me is that when you don't feel good, you just want to get the problem fixed quickly. LEMONAID is very easy to use. It is straight forward. They ask you the pertinent questions and your situation is reviewed by a physician. They get the name of your pharmacy and send your prescription within minutes..........  Very simple !  It's very fast and when you feel sick you don't want to have hassle and you don't want slow, you want it fixed quickly.  The physician responded to me in less than one hour. I can't even get my primary care physician to answer my call in less than an hour. That says a lot about their service.   I highly recommend LEMONAID!!""Leamonaid Health is easy, straight forward, and a real boon to those of us who are between doctors or just plain busy. Even outside of business hours the turn around is amazingly quick and the Doctors are all exceptionally courteous. I'd give it 6 stars if I could!""I received very quick, competent service and secured a needed prescription within 1 hour. Easy to use and very quick response.""Easy to use, secure, and fast responses received. This app is a game changer for people who can't get to a doctor regardless of their circumstance. Would gladly recommend to anyone.""The visit was quick and painless. Lol. Dr Liu was friendly and informative. The app experience was flawless as well. I recommend tgis app.""House calls are back in a big way!!! Lemonaid 4life""It was a Saturday, It took me fifteen minutes to sign-up. I got approved the same day, outside of business hours, and received a notification my prescription was ready that afternoon from my pharmacy. I could not be happier. Best app ever.""Installed the app and had the prescription I needed within 10 hours. This app charges a reasonable rate which is basically the cherry on top of not having to find a new doctor, pay the office fee, wait in a waiting room, tell 3 people the same information, or submit to humiliating uncomfortable exams as a new patient.  Thank you for knowing the chemistry of my medications and making an informed, medical decision without taking advantage of me! Exactly what I want in a provider :)  Update: prescription for birth control in a 3 month supply, with an additional 3 refills - 9 months total... does it get better? I submit that it does not.""Hmmm, randomly raising the price of the visit. Going to another service where the price is the $15 and they ship to your door.""Thank goodness for Lemonaid! I visited a doctor for my first birth control prescription, but my husband and I move/travel frequently for his job. It's made renewing my script a stressful nightmare. I've been using this app for a year, and I've always experienced excellent quality of care. The app is easy to use, and I've always been able to communicate any questions to my Lemonaid doctor. One time, the app froze after submitting payment, so I called their main business number. A very nice lady handled my call and got the issue cleared up for me in about an hour. Thank you, Lemonaid, for the service you provide! I hope you will be available in all 50 states so women don't have to experience that panicked moment when they're close to running out of pills. I fully support and recommend in-person doctor visits, too, but when you're trying to avoid pregnancy, there is no room for error. Thanks for the peace of mind!""This stupid app keeps telling me I'm too young to use this. I'm over 18. 1 star because zero functionality for me. If it's glitching that much, I can only imagine the HIPAA security.""I ran out of my prescription sooner than I thought, and didn't have time to go to the doctor. I tried this app and ordered my prescription at 8pm. Lemonaid approved my request right away and the next day my prescription was filled (3 months worth of pills) and ready to be picked up! All I had to do was give them my insurance information! (You can pay cash, but I knew this would be cheaper). GREAT app and just what I needed. I'd recommended it to everyone I know.""It will not let me type my card expiration date so I can't get what I need.""If you are a busy woman, and need one of the things they offer here, it's worth it. They are responsible and fast.""Not good if you don't have a credit card. Or don't have a bank account.""I spent the entire day searching for a new ob/gyn after finding out that I was out of refills and my old doctor wouldn't take my new insurance. Having PCOS, I didn't want to risk going a month without. I'm so glad I found Lemonaid Health. It was so easy to set up a visit and when I had a problem with uploading a picture on the app, someone called me back right away. I am so thankful for this new innovation in healthcare. It's a time and money saver. Thank you!""I never thought this was going to work. Being in good health going for an exam every time I need a BC refill (every THREE months!) seemed absurd and my busy schedule really didn't allow it. Plus who wants to get poked around just for a pack of pills? I decided to just try it and I'm happy to say this app got me what I needed, and you actually talk to a doctor after for follow up. Plus I didn't have to wait 3 weeks and pay a copay!""I called around my whole town and the lowers cost woman's annual exam I could find was $180. I don't have insurance and was looking for an alternative. So glad I found Lemonaid Health. $15 & a few questions later & I got the email saying the prescription for my birth control was sent over to the pharmacy. I called the pharmacy to confirm my prescription and they were already processing it! I'm thoroughly impressed and will definitely be using Lemonaid Health again in the near future.""After needing to get a New birth control prescription and not having time to go in for an appointment I tried this app out. I submitted the  information for my visit at around 10pm and woke up at 2am with a response. I was impressed with the quickness. My prescription was ready at the pharmacy when I went in late in the day. Overall spent less than my typical copay for office visits! I will be recommending to my friends""Can't give the app a good review, as I never received the email to open/confirm my account.""I have to say I was hesitant at first to use this app, but I'm delighted I did. You basically pay for an email consultation with a doctor who can review your prescreening questions (like you get from all doctor's offices when you're new) and see if you are suitable for what you're requesting. Nothing is mailed to you, you pick it up from a pharmacy of your choice and if you have insurance you can use it when picking your meds up. Super fast, super communicative, and super easy!!""This app was so easy to use, they take paypal which made me feel more secure. Like advertised, I got a message from the dr. within 2 hours saying that he approved my request and put in my script. I had the pills in my hand the next day (it could have been sooner but I didn't have the time to go to the pharmacy the same day). Super convenient, I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get on birth control but can't immediately see the obgyn for whatever reason.""I spent the day trying to figure out in a mad dash how to get myself some birth control in time. Planned parenthood was by appointment only and a week away. This made the process very easy, fast, and pleasant and well worth it! Wonderful and very friendly user interface and doctors. Will be recomending it to my friends.     Update; PLEASEEEE spread to more states... Places like utah you have to deal with planned parenthood and its pushed getting my perscription back by weeks cause it's just horrible. ;~;""I downloaded this app as a single mom, thinking I could get some help in a pinch. Dead wrong. You'd think I was trying to get a schedule II narcotic. Nope, just antibiotics for a UTI. Because the app kept timing me out, I logged back in and was marked as having a symptom  (fever) which I dont. The dr refused to send an antiviotic in and refused to help me at all. TYPICAL MEDICAL FIELD treatment. Love a Dr that doesn't listen to a patient. Absolute worst experience ever!!!! Thanks for wasting my time & pain!""I was in a ton of pain at 3am with a UTI and was searching home remedies when I came across this app. I followed the prompts and entered my symptoms and when they opened at 8am I instantly received a message that a prescription was sent to me local pharmacy! The doctor also sent a detailed description of treatment and the prescription information and told me to feel better! All for $15!!! What an amazing app. This is the future of health care!""I can't believe how helpful this app is. My local women's health center was having me come in every month to fill a birth control I've been taking since I was 16. Their office was always busy so I'd have to take four hours, unpaid, off of work just to sit with an aide for 5 minutes to get a refill. Lemonaid is easy to use and more helpful than I could have imagined. I was also suffering from some pretty bad acne. It took 24 hours to get a prescription and my skin had never looked better""When trying to log back in i realized i never got my email from them the conferm my account and get my password...""Discovered this app by accident yesterday about 3p.m.  Since I've had a UTI for a couple days and was dreading going to the doctor I decided to try this.  Answered all the questions, paid my $15 bucks and sent my request on its way.  Since it was late in the day I didn't really expect an email or anything until today.  It is now 5:34pm and I still haven't heard a word!  I cannot even get into the app far enough to make a complaint and ask for my money back.  Oh well, you live you learn.""Amazing to get a rx without having to sit in a dr's office and to top it off, only 15$!  Completed my visit and got an email my script was sent in 15mins. I requested the wrong one and it was fixed in 5mins..  Issue my cc was saying unknown error try later, saw paypal option so just paid with same card through that, and the message feature isnt available in the app, had to use browser online. Still 5 stars in my book for convenience!""I waited for my prescription to finish out before rating. After submitting my photos and description for my acne,  Dr. Hang replied within the hour, and asked me probing questions to find out the root cause of my acne. After determining that my case was because of a common dermatitis, he prescribed me 2 medications to use together and they worked wonderfully.  Dr. Hwang even conversed with me back and forth until 10:30pm to make sure he had all the information he needed. Very satisfied with this service.""Created my account, read through info, chose the medicine I wanted and followed all steps. From the moment I answered the consult questions, answered direct message from doctor to picking my prescription from pharmacy took about 3.5 hours. This was great as I couldn't wait the 2 weeks to see my doctor.  Great app, keep up the great work. Will use again and recommend""After making my account I was given enough information to know that they would not be able to help with my problem. I left a review asking how to delete my account, and not only was it deleted for me, but they called and left a lovely message saying that they did. I am so impressed. I will definitely be keeping this app in mind when I need my birth control prescription renewed. Thank you!""*****Downloaded this app in the middle of the night for a mild emergency, by the time I woke the doctor had reviewed my case and sent in a prescription. I showered, dressed and went down to my local Walmart to pick it up with no hassles! Does EXACTLY what it claims to. Awesome work! Plus, a money back guarantee! !*****""Who has the time to dedicate a doctor's visit during the week, or sit for hours in a clinic just to get birth control?! I don't! This app is exactly what I've been waiting for. So easy, so informed, so seamless. Thank you to the creating team, you're geniuses and revolutionizing the world for women.""This is a quick easy way to take care of business. For me personally I did not want to have to go to Planned Parenthood, and it really bothers me that a woman can buy plan b over the counter but has to waste time and money going to a doctor for a birth control rx. I am very thankful.""    ""com.lbrc.PeriodCalendar"":     ""Useful and informative""It's very informative, tracks very well""GREAT!! IT LET'S ME KNOW WHEN I'M GONNA LEAK MY HUMAN LIQUID'S.!!!! No but really it's a great app really informative.""Password is very useful and no obvious signs on what that app is about""UPDATED 2/18/18- I've used this for 6 months now, it has worked perfectly for Peri-menopause. I could go over my notes and I go over with my doctor when he asked me questions. I recommend this app also if you are tracking menopause also.  5 stars now.  **8/1/17 I just downloaded this app, so far it works good for my purposes. I like the layout, easy, user friendly. I have been on the pill for 30 yrs and now need to know if i am in menopause. This will help me track and keep notes each month I DON'T get my period now. And if I do I can start counting my 12 months again.  I only gave 4 stars since its new to me and if it work as expected I will come back and make it 5 stars.""Very accurate information""Simple,  has reminders and one touch editing; lets you look back over time, has predictions that are almost always accurate information, lets you add detail notes exc..   Love this app. THANKS!""I have been using it for over a year now and it's so wonderful. I used to never remember to chart my period but now it prompts me, as well as is easy. It also has so much information if you need to you mark your symptoms as well.""Best tracker I have found....and hopeful because of this ap we will have a new bundle of joy very soon!! Pass code option is a plus and the design and layout is beautiful and efficient.""It is very good and informative""Accurate information""i want to add historical data.""I accidentally deleted the app then when I restored my data it didn't restore .and I had backed up my data to my gmail before I deleted tha app.  So I lost all my data""It's completely Helpful and Great app i always wanted to have this kinda app in my mobile loved it and it Also helpful to keep remind me this event that ususally i forget i couldn't kept my dates in my mind but really appreciate your work keep improve it more better otherwise its all Good and like the theme as well \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb""It's a really practical app for both girl teenagers and adult women. I love that it has a password so other people don't enter to snoop.""The app start got too slow. Period prediction always shifts, but if I set the prediction method to manual and back to automatic it solves. Annoying.""    ""com.lifescan.reveal"":     ""A great app Can store all the readings and other information in one place for quick access and analysis. Thanks for this product.""The most stupid app ever seen. It doesn't allow to check box of disclaimer to create account.""It works but he's poorly integrated with other apps. Hey one touch look at One Drop, much more information...much. Integrate with fitbit!""Can't finish filling out the registration form. Keeps going back to the email address once I get to the clinical code.""I would like to have this on my COMPUTER! I DON'T NEED OR WANT IT ON MY PHONE.  Where is my option?  Now, after spending half my morning tapping on your \"One month at a time\" calendar to register, I quit. I would have to tap your frikken calendar 792 times to go back in time to put in Feb 23, 1952! WOW! What a waste of time.""His calendar to get user date is faulty. you start with today's date. Then you hit back arrow 600 times to get to birthdates 1950. You select your date of birth like Dec15. You think you are done. No it says you don't meet the age criteria. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.""The new version of the app is pretty nice, however the older version used to show the average of the BGS'. Now it show the last reading which is also just below that.  Seems kind of redundant. I don't need to see my last reading twice on the home page.  Would love to have the Average(s) back.  Also, I have not been able to find the BGS Average any where in the App.  The average allow me to see where I maybe in my A1C's before I visit the doctor.""One of the worst apps I've ever installed. First to create an account you have to scroll back each month on the calendar for me that was 50 years worth. Then it wouldn't let me create an account. So I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. This time it actually let me press set up account only for it to not let me complete the email and password to complete the account... Complete waste of time!! Fix it!""Why do I have to consent to my location being used for this app? Slow, clunky, not even worth the price. I have been a big fan of one touch before, but not now.""By registering it looks like I may be sharing my personal information with just about everybody on the face of the earth""Meter has to be used with the app because the simple function of recording whether or not you've eaten has been taken off the meter. You must use the app or loose that data. My old Verio meter had a light up section on the nose of the meter, that helps guide your blood drop to its destination, that's gone.  Instead of using a rechargeable lithium battery they use a button cell. But getting PDF reports is great. Kaiser only accepts PDF or JPG. Old discontinued software made TIF files and hard to extract it and convert it. Now if it interface with \"MyfitnessPal\" calorie counter. I would be able to make intelligent adjustment to my Insulin dosage to drive my sugar level lower without fear of crashing. One of these days?""Helps to keep me informed at a quick glance and when I visit my Dr they can see my results""Had to back up the calendar about 700 clicks to select my birthday! After all that it will not sync to the monitor.""The app will not let me create an account.""Nearly impossible to set birth date when youj can only go back 1 month at a time. Deleted app""Requires location services be turned on or will not sync.  Entering account info is extremely difficult ie had to scroll Thursday 42 years of calenders one month at a time to enter birthdate. Customer support is worse than worthless""I couldn't get an account to use.  And as tried it took forever to get bday as you had to go through each month to get there.  I tried 4 times and gave up trying to create an account.  Very frustrating to someone who is trying to do this for first time ever as just received a meter""So to be able to use this app you need to put your age in, but it won't let me type it, I basically have to click scroll from today to 40 years ago?!? Limiting people's ability to use your app because of poor code is unfortunate""Can't create an account""For something that should be a Simple app to set up it takes almost all your information except for blood type and takes an extreme amount of time just to start. Never finished the process it seems to be a waste of time and refused to give out information that people simply do not need""Very stupid app. First it ask you to chose your birthday from a calendar they provide where you have to go hundreds of hundreds of months back, then it ask you for a clinic code to go any further ...what the he*** is a clinic code? Stupid, plus has a very catchy and weird policies ...dont waste your time.""Easy to use app!! Very informative!!""Can't register.  Won't let me put in date of birth except to scroll back calendar from 2018 to 1949. Are you kidding me???""Unable to sync with Redmi 4 mobile. Not pairing in Bluetooth""The sync issues are horrible.  Having so many problems with this.  There are 4 ways to troubleshoot this problem and it's never the same problem twice.  I spend more time trying to fix this issue then actually using the app.  Now I can't sync at all and I've spent over an hour trying to fix this to no avail.  It's actually easier to just write the readings down from the meter to compare against previous days.  Back to the 20th century way of doing things I guess sigh""I've been using the meter for less than a month. Syncing with meter constantly fails now but no problem syncing with account. I bought this version so it'll eliminate the hassle of inputting numbers into a report, but I'm ending up doing that anyway. Except now it won't show the trends because the numbers are manually entered in. I've tried unpairing, repairing, uninstalling and reinstalling, turn off/on, reset my phone, you name it. Still not syncing with meter. Please fix this asap.""Some features on device could be easier to use. Put instructions on back of unit maybe?""I get an error message when the app attempts to sync to my account. Uninstall  add re install. Still does not work.""Took a while to get it to sync and rang the helpline. After that so easy. It's a better way of keeping a check on my BG. I particularly like the ability to leave a note for each reading. On my other monitor all the information was stored on that,but now I use this app. Very handy now that I've got used to it. Would recommend.""Very hard to login to my data""The update for this app did something so my account email comes in on all high case characters and now it won't sync with the meter correctly.  I think I will just go get a new meter.I can't mess around with useless tech!""T bought this meter , downloaded app, went to set app up and it's not working. I enter email, password and that's all it will do. Won't let me continue.  Im not that dumb , and it's very basic. Junk""So far, Excellent. Seems to lag when syncing to the meter till I figured out how to force syncing, it's not documented anywhere. 1. Turn on meter 2. Open app and pull down on the white half circle with the last reading. It will sync with Account and the meter if it's on. (Galaxy S8+, Android OS, v7).""App is really buggy. Can't get through account creation. Freezes and no support accessible.""Worst birthday entering system invented by man.  Your programmer should be shot.  To require a finger press per month to go back 63 years is extremely idiotic, moronic and stupid.  plus trying to sign up it dies, wont let you sign up  Deleted it""It won't let me do nothing can't sync & won't take my information""2017-0122 great app, small bug.  It will not let me specify 12:00pm as the start for lunch.. It always refers back to AM. I'm forced to list lunch at 12:10pm.  No syncing issues on the Samsung 8+""Wireless? This is FAR better than using a cable or hand-copying your data.""Not able to create an account in the first place, forget about using it. The cursor goes back to first field and never reaches Create Account button. The button always remains disabled. Many have logged this complaint. Why are you not fixing it?""Very easy to use, log pertinent data, and track. Makes doctor visits quick and easy. Highly recommended.""Can't even create account. Total waste of time. Hope your machine is better than this app.""Repeated crashes. Unusable since it can't sync with account""Unable to login after entering the email I'd and password setup it again move to first column... Some technical issues... Kindly correct it""Won't let me sign in, took forever to figure the date of birth process but after telling it my gender and type of diabetes and I hit sign up a pop-up screen appears telling me to make decisions based on my meter and doctor when I click okay takes me back to the sign up screen instead of proceeding""It worked fine at first but the latest update screwed up the graph display. Now all the data points are displayed along the bottom instead of inside the appropriate colour zone.""Some issues with data presentation (not very flexible) but otherwise I like this tool. Helpful for managing my blood suggar.""I might like it if I could get started using it. The date of birth field would require me to scroll back for 56 years to get to the right date. I don't have that kind of spare time. Why don't you make it where I can just KEY IN my birthdate?""I'm a new diabetic and find this app 100% useful and highly recommend it for anyone wanting to track their blood glucose levels and any trends. Download this app and explore it to find that it offers an outstanding array of options and tools to help you manage your diabetes data!""The app won't sync with the meter, because the meter doesn't show the PIN as the documentation says it should. Why do I have to enter my birthday to use this app? I was born in 1953, and had to step back one month at a time, 773 button presses to set my birthday. Who decided this was a good idea? Leaving the Bluetooth on in the meter drained the battery in 4 days.""I want the old version back at least it would sync with my meter.""It won't even allow me to register an account it won't move forward with the account set up when entering the email and password confirm.   Need to get this fixed! Its making one touch look bad""When I originally received meter and app it worked great, after 89 readings  it won't sink with meter anymore. I spent almost an hour with customer support making me late for work we got my S7 to sink with meter, this morning it no longer syncs again. Don't get meter. Allows hackers another way into your information""Gives me the data i need""Easy to use. Color coding very helpful. Great for my doctor to check.""Very informative. Being newly diagnosed this app helps keep all my readings from different meters all together. Thanks""Great, no more time consuming manual entries, easy to read graphs  to see at a glance daily, weekly, or monthly data.""Great app....when it finally works. Sync issues must be fixed. I find leaving the test strip in then opening app reduces attempts to sync. Also, bring back the Bluetooth prompt when opening app, may also ease syncing issues for those that may forget to do it manually.""Like the new fingerprint password, helpfull articles, and link to Walgreens connect app.""I have had no problems with the app, just couldn't remember my password.""It's nice to be able to sync the meter but the app falls short in usability. Its like they never talked to real diabetics. If you are devoted to tight tracking it may not be worth the hassle of the bad ux just to get your glucose measurement entered automatically.  For example, why slap a giant image in the way of data entry or put the insulin and carb entry buttons behind the keyboard so you have to scroll all the time? And the kind of reports and graphs they provide are not the ones diabetics and doctors actually use. Perhaps the only reason the app exists is to monetize your disease with its cloud sync.""Difficult to pair up & enter information. Have had to uninstalled it more than I care to & it till will not pair. Twice they found each other but failed when I tried to type in the code. Is it 6 digits or 4? There were 2 digits a space then 4 more digits & God help you trying to see the small digits. Not pleased or amused. Quite frustrating.""Worked for few days then ??  Just will not add more.  Deleted, reinstalled, Paired ok.  But not  syncing. .  My email address shows all capitals, entering your age is easy but difficult to figure out.  Adding manually messes it up.  Got wrong reading on reader.  Redo showed 7 not 8.   This happened several times at my my cost of strips this is not good.   Idea. Is good.  Just did not work for me.""You cannot just login with Facebook even though the app says it'll tell you who unfriended you. You have to put in all of your information including your birth date and year they start with 2017 I was born 1966 it's a 12 month calendar for each year as I tap and tap and tap my screen gets bigger and then smaller. It's incredibly hard and time consuming to get from 2017 to 1966 an app that's supposed to give you all of your Facebook information but first  I have to let them have all of my information....""Cause I don't have a code I can't set up an account""App works well for me sometimes I have to restart the connection between the meter and tablet but works all the time saving data.""I wish there was a way to prompt a sync with the meter.  Sometimes it will sync the account a dozen times but not with the meter, and I want to enter a memo on that reading before I forget, so the delay is annoying. I also wish there was a way to enter medication reminder alarms into the app.  If that feature were integrated with dosage/time of administration and a way to enter meal info and exercise, the tracking and feedback could be much more helpful.  It would turn this single-product auxiliary app into a truly integrated diabetes management platform.""Generally works well, sometimes Slow link. Enjoy keeping track.""DO NOT BUY this brand: Lancers only last for a few weeks, then you have to prick your fingers with a needle manually, sync problems almost every time, can't enter blood glucose information, app doesn't fit properly in landscape mode, some information hidden. Even with their attempt to have app constantly running in the background (which they shouldn't do), they have failed. They can't be testing their hardware or software at all. Idiots: this is very serious, please get out of the business, these products need to be tested before they're released. Let somebody with a sense of responsibility do this. I (and others) need these products to function, I'm going with another brand, I don't have a choise.""This App is worthless. I use it with my One touch VeriIQ. No report. Nothing on my account.""Excellent working on my Android 6 mobile. Someone fedup to software and bluetooth pairing. The can't read manual.

Had to uninstall and reinstall APP which is garbage.""I hate having to page back years for my birthdate.  When i tried to pair with my asus phone it took a dozen tries.  After the first sync, i have not been able to sync since. Useless""Date of birth entry is the worst I've ever seen. The second account creation page also bugs a lot, wouldn't leave the first email box, had to do over again. And go through that ridiculously stupid fate of birth entry window. Keys don't always register, constantly asking for permissions, I truly hope they'll polish and optimise this app because it is extremely poor in its current state, but much needed for diabetes management. On the plus side, the app looks nice - it just doesn't feel as good as it looks. EDIT: Also asking for bluetooth permission request (when it's set to off) on the device every 5s is getting annoying really fast. And I understand you're using Android's native date picker but like I mentionned and like many other users mentionned, it's HORRIBLE design and the worst date picker ever.""Great app. I can use it to compile my data and graph it. Helps me see where my blood sugars are at.""Date of birth entry is the worst user interface.  Key Data entry is horrible it freezes up.  If Fixed it may be better. Also bluetooth pairing is jacked up... Big time bug fixes needed.  Interesting no one has responded on a plan to update the do entry and Bluetooth connection problems.""Won't let me set up an account stuck on the email and password page""Good app but I deducted stars for requiring a password, 8 characters no less.  Give me an option to select NO password.""Ok app but really need two buttons. One sync with meter and on sync with account.  Tired of swiping down and waiting while the software decides which should be done. It is a waste of my time. Looks cool but useless for folks on the go....sitting and waiting, and waiting...""Birthday calendar takes too long to set up. Blue Tooth has response issues.  Password reset response takes too long.  Product was obviously never consumer tested.""Could not get past create an account. Junk""Could not even get past set up account""good app. lets me share data with my practitioners more easily than manually recording my glucose measurements.""I love the data captured and the ease of sending the information to my Dr""This is a great app and it's so easy to use. I love how it calculates everything foe you and it's so easy to just screen shot the info and email to my doctors.""Can't even create an account it won't change the year in date of birth section and after scrolling back 20 plus years in the calender it still didn't work!!!""Can't see well also I'm slow""Makes managing my readings easy. The information is always a touch away and patterns are great for helping me straighten out those bad habits of mine.

Scrolling back the calender to the year your born is ridiculous""If you aren't quick with your insulin units the screen disappears and I can't get it back!""My doctor and I both like the information available through the app like patterns and averages, and percentage of high, low, and in range readings for 14, 30 and 90 day ranges.""Easy to use. A bit slow syncing from meter to galaxy s5. Also would be nice to apply more characters in the notes of the blood glucose section.""One touch defiantly would only let me touch once on the first name then nothing else. I tried checking the box and submitting nope guess i used my one touch on the first name owell wont let me set up an account""I think that sucks that you can't register your birthdate you have to go back 49 years on the calendar you can just enter the date and I also hate the fact that you can't get past the clinical code to actually register so something's wrong with your application it's not very user-friendly""With the upgrades it makes sense of my reading. The new information about how sugar reaction during and after sickness and mornig high. This app is great!!!!!!""It would be a good idea to have a notes section where you can list the medications being taken and maybe show emergency contact information.""Even let me create an account""API to let users download readings as raw data limits ability to related this with other personal health metrics""Gives me information I did not have access before unless I wanted to keep a log book""When getting set up the app kept locking on a screen am not letting me move forward.

""com.ovuline.fertility"":     ""Love it, really helps me remember and give good information.""This is the most accurate and helpful app. Easy to use and log data.""Great tips and information. Easy to use.""I have just started my TTC journey and I have been beyond pleased with this app. It is super informative and asks for so much information to calculate your cycle. I highly recommend this app to anyone TTC or anyone that wants an easy way to track their cycle!""Absolutely fantastic and is full of so much information around ovulation, fertility and much more like recipes! I really enjoy this app and would recommend it highly.""Great educational material. Easy to track data. Great info about predicting fertility and it adjust based on data you enter. So the results are geared specifically to you. This is by far the best tracker I've used.""I love this app I've been using it for 6 months now it gives you great information it has help me keep track of my period and when to expect my next period and it's always right on the point. If my period is late it will adjust and still let me know when I'm going to ovulate my fiance and I have been trying to get pregnant now for 4 months I'm hoping this month will be the month that we conceive fingers crossed! Also I love the fact that it gives information that I didn't even know before about being pregnant or people who are trying to conceive. It gives you good tips and good advice! I absolutely love it I would recommend it to anyone!""Used to love it, but now it wont let me login or sign up again. Hate that i can no longer use it, especially since this had all of my information, and i dont remember when my last period was. So not helpful when TTC.""Very interactive and informative tracking app! Better than the other ones I've used in the past. Thanks""I love it. Very informative.""Really great. I love how much information you can put in to be as accurate as possible!""Great app for women. It contains the required data of which we have a question in mind""Wonderful App. So much information""Very informative, positive and supportive!""I love it, is easy to use and very informative. You will fall in love with this app.""Maybe add push notifications to remind users to add data. Otherwise this is the best app to use for tracking fertility. So thorough and easy to use""Super user friendly and informative""This app really worked beyond my expectations. I had found that when the rhythm method was used alone in other apps, it was not nearly as accurate as Ovia's app, which paired the rhythm method with cervical mucus and basal temp measurements. Spot on pretty much every time! Offered me great cycle insights about recurring symptoms I have during each phase. The app setup is also very nice. Easy to use. It lets you upload data to excel and to a doctor if you want. The anonymous community support is so very nice to have. Women offer one another advice and support. It is really great. I cannot say enough good things about this app! Even for those not trying to conceive, it is a very useful app to keep track of periods! I have definitely recommended this to many people!""The most precise and informing site for couples trying to concieve. I've used a ton of these apps for TTC. But this app is by far the most outstandingly informative and precise I've ever used and/or seen. Totally beyond impressed.""It's is great app that is very efficient at helping you keep track of things and provides a wellspring of interesting, useful information. It also has some very useful, unexpected features. I highly recommend this app.""Impossible to edit data.""Easy to use and informational!""Easy to use and informative!""Nice informative app.""Thought I'd try this app and see if there was anything I was missing in my old reliable p tracker app. After using Ovia for a few months I've decided to delete it because it's slow, clunky and not easy to use. It feels like I'm forever tapping and scrolling to log things that in my other app would take 2-3 taps. Not easy to use at 5.30am when you just want to record your temp. I also found the news-feed style home page unhelpful. The thing that annoys me the most about this app is that as soon as it thinks you should be on your period, it logs that for you. So if you're not on your period you have to go and change it every day until your period does arrive.""Very informative and accurate""Very informative, easy to use and very helpful when trying to get pregnant. It track your fertile window and information is very accurate. I highly recommend this app when trying to conceive.""\u00a3ove this app sooo informational & does all the guessing for me""Really helps. App is obviously o my as good at giving information; giving symptoms are put in by yourself. Go more info you put in better results. Baby dust to all ttc with this app x""This app is very accurate and I hope it helps me conceive by using my data entered.""I absolutely love this app but it keeps logging me out and then I have to keep re-entering my information. Please fix the issue""Very detailed and so much information""This app is amazing It took us only one month of actual TTC!!   First off I love that you can set it for both TTC and not TTC because I started app in 2/17 to track my periods and cycles.   Then in preperation of TTC on 10/1/17 I started tracking my BBT and useing clear blue ovulation kits and entering my data in the App everyday. I did this so I would have a good idea of my cycles and ovulation trends for when we began TTC in January of 2018.   Based off the previous 3 months of data tracking on the app I was able to start doing the things I needed when I needed like...Drinking more whole milk, eating avacados and almonds.Taking Omega 3 vitamins as well as my prenatal and my husband also took extra zinc vitamins.  We were even able to plan a baby makation for my fertile window. It was really just to celebrate the fact that we were finally TTC.   Then low and behold when the app alerted me to take a pregnancy test we had a BFP!   We were both shocked that it happened so fast. We are so thankful that this app was able to help us so accurately. Definitely a must for women TTC or Not TTC.""Very easy to use. Love all the information in it too. Great app""I would've liked it more if it wasn't so glitchy. It's constantly signing me out and it takes more than 15 tries to log back in. As of yesterday I cannot fully log in as it glitches right back to the log in page. I would recommend if it didn't glitch every single time.""This app has an incredible number of things you can track and is full of great graphics so that more women can learn what is going on their cycles.  If you're only looking for forums and message boards to connect with other users, I'd skip this app.  In fact, I find the forums on Ovia to be almost unusable, so I kept my other cycle app for access to their forms. However, if you're looking for an app to track as many data points as possible, you can't go wrong with Ovia! I love it!""My only issue is it won't let me set up my own timezone and so the date is wrong and when I try to put in my 4 digit zip code it has a fit. Australia only uses 4 digits. For your information.  ;)""It won't send a password reset email and when I gave up on that I tried making a new account it kept sending me to the sign in page after asking my basic info. So frustrated with it.""I will know more as I go, but so far I love how sensitive this is to my daily input. It adjusts my fertiole window based on ALL info, not just 1 or 2 favorites, like other apps I've used. It's modern but still scientific, so I feel good when I open it up :)""Awesome app! I love the advice and information that comes as you mark your symptoms.""It is constantly deleting my data. I had 4 days of temps logged, all gone. It just deleted my last period. Very inconvenient. Will be deleting this app.""Great App! It has a lot more for you to use free that other apps would charge for, I've found this app so helpful and simple to use. The only thing I would say is it tends to be a day or two early when predicting my cycle but that could be down to the information I have entered.""I was really loving this app almost had my cycle down and everything else that's important but somehow a couple weeks ago all my data I've logged in for 2 months just disappeared and I have yet to be to regain any of my data from last couple months""I like it but it doesn't reajuat to when you put information in. I.E. ovulation""Great for helping to track my chronic pain, medications, etc. Would be better if the app showed my own regular medications when logging data so that I don't have to type it in every day.""This app is so informative and really helpful! I've learned so much, and it's an easy and great way to understand what's going on with my body""I feel more informed about my body. I love this app!""Awesome app! I wish I could have found it sooner. Been with another app for couple of years which somehow gives  accurate prediction of my period but Ovia gives much better information as well as helpful tips! :)""This app is very helpful, easy to use and ofcourse lots of data!""Very helpful! I like the tracking of my fertility and reading information about things I could do to help conceive in all areas.""Great app! Super easy and informative.""Excellent app, very informative.""Great app ! it lets you put in a ton of info and the layout is simple and provides a lot of information as well as a supportive community.""It's SO easy to put in all your information and gives you a ton of awesome information. And the calendar is easy to read. It's perfect for people like me who are lazy with this stuff. But it takes a long time for it to really track your cycle so it's just frustrating having it take so long and changes your fertile window so often during this time""Awesome app!!! Great articles with super interesting information! Love it!!!""Gives me all needed information while I am ttc""Very easy to use and very informative.  Good for tracking symptoms and period even if you are not trying to get pregnant.""Have had this app for 4 months, been trying to conceive for over a year now and found out 1/29/18 we are having a baby.... great app of you fill in your data daily!!!!! Very on point wmand accurate . Thanks Ovia""Easy, intuitive, and informative!""when my phone updating, i lot all my data. I logged in but i don't see any of myvpast entry. Very disappointed""Such an amazing app, very informative and helpful""    ""com.caremark.caremark"":     ""*Rx. Records DO NOT WORK.* The Rx.History that states it can go back up to 18 months, 1 year, so on... To obtain your Rx. Records DOES NOT WORK. IT ONLY GOES BACK TO THE DATE OF DEC.7TH.2017. HUGE LET DOWN. Considering one only seeks that particular function for something IMPORTANT, like taxes or court. And it's not like you can do much with the app anyways. It had around 6 major functions, 1 of which completely sucks at working. Unless ordering perscriptions (via this app.) is the only way you can obtain them, this app. is useless.""Many features of the app are not responsive. I can start mail service but cannot view ID card. Uninstalled.""Doesn't work on Mobil phone""Is this a fraud site? They didn't even spell \"about\" correctly on the main screen. And the app wants permission to all sorts of data from my phone that seems unreasonable.  I'm not putting my private information into this suspicious app.""The card doesn't show up in the app""I downloaded the app so I could have the convenience of having my RX card on my phone. However when I got to the pharmacy and loaded the app, it wouldn't let me sign in, app kept crashing. I uninstalled and reinstalled. It finally let me sign in. I tapped \"view ID card\" and the card popped up in the screen with no information. Tried clicking on ither tabs and the app crashed again. I had to log on to the actual website and load the card from there. I will be uninstalling this app. No use having it; taking up storage space, when it can't even be used.  Good idea for an app, but CVS shouldn't have launched it, if it can't even be used.""The app shuts down unexpectedly constantly all day every day. I like that it has my Rx card on it but I can barely use it and I could never sign up for the mail order service bc it kicks me out, I had to go to the site and fill out the form and mail it in. I have cleared cache and reinstalled. Please fix.""Stopped working....ive used it for a few years. It was not very functional or informative....kinda like CVS who's prescription service sucks anyway""Idea is great, execution on this and their mobile app on Androids is just terrible. It needs significant work. Organization of the home page of the app is confusing as ever and not intuitive. Buttons and drop-downs don't work; I feel like I'm in a QA or test version. How was this released to production? Their Technology team needs to investigate.""Links don't work and menus won't load. Can't get past opening page to start an account.""Unable to sign in. Won't let me into the password box to type my password.""Worthless.  No ability to check prices.  Message is member termed yet I can access everything else including my active member card through the app.  A big, useless fail. And a waste of time.""Scanner works mostly, but you can type Rx so it's cool. Like not having to authenticate just to scan. :)""App sends me to their website when trying to access prescriptions. Why have an app if it does that? No problem logging into my account but no prescriptions were found. It seems very glitchy right now.""Why is this app so large?  At 184 mb its the largest app on my phone. Even larger than an office program I have on my phone. Since my last review this app has grown with every update. It now shows 240MB and cannot be transfered to sd card. I think I will be uninstalling pretty soon and just use web interface.""Registered online then downloaded the app now it says my username and password are invalid what's happening??""Awful. When I want to change anything in my account, it takes me to my internet browser. When I try to take pictures of my prescription paper, all I get is \"the brightness is insufficient, kindly retake the photo\". No matter how many lights I have on our how bright, it automatically corrects the brightness to be too dark to accept, apparently, and occasionally it even crashes when I take the picture. And this is the only way I can get my prescriptions thanks to my insurance. What a let-down.""I have had this app since the beginning of the year and it has run fine. For the last 4-6 weeks  I am able to login, but cannot access any of my prescription information. I have no trouble on my desk top. Using the same Moto Z that I started the app with. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app. A little help.""CVS claim to fame is come back in 2 hours. Then they try to steer you for mail order Rx. Then when the doctor writes a script, they play God and tell you they want you to take other meds first. Even the app is a dud. Stay away from them.""The app may work fine, but the staff at Caremark are awful.  Quick to take money but slow to ship medicine""ID is not populated on the card and therefore worthless at the pharmacy.  Had to go home and dig out the paper copy. Please fix.""What good is the app if all you can do is sign in. Would rather go back to my own, RELIABLE pharmacy.""The app has the essential data. I would like to see a finger print unlock solution or even a 4 digit code like many recent apps.  Also, is it possible for the user to set the time out period?""Useless. Why have a \"remember me\" feature and still have to enter a password? And there is a separate app for specialty that is pretty much the same.""Terrible app. Have install an uninstall multiple times.  Go to check priced and says we are termed--what the heck. Try to do family access and won't let us. Look at faq and it says go to \" \" and no link listed.  Multiple tried for it to finally accept script for mail order, and go to check status of that later and it shows nothing. For all we know it is lost in cyber space and it is not in process. This is a terrible app. Not to mention yiu can not see entire ID card as ID is not listed.  Showed it to pharmacist and they said it missing info. They listen to call where I told they can bill without having my indivual ID number! Ha ha.  Had to use anotger pharmacy and same issue as app that says view ID card doed not list all ID info. Calling caremark is not much better--took almost 5 months and getting employer advocacy department involved to fix an issue that should have been fixed on day one. Instead it cost us, the members, hundreds of dollars that caremark will not reimburse. Shame on them for their greed.  Caremark/cvs is not a company recommend to anyone. App.is worthless as it shows nothing or helps--have had the app.for at least 6 months and been trying to use it. Updates to it have not helped either.""Overall good app. Needs the option to be able to move to the SD card.""Will not accept my username and password. Both work perfectly on the web site but not on their lousy app""Horrid app, & I have a new phone!  Was able to log in, & that's it. None of the icons on main screen were responsive to ANY touch. Could do absolutely nothing. Uninstalled, & back to phone sys & website for me. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge""Cannot see deductible information that you can see on Web site.""I downloaded the app because Caremark is my mail-order pharmacy for my insurance plan.  I immediately logged in using the credentials used for the on-line site, and was able to refill one of my prescriptions at once.  Also, like the online site, I could access prescriptions for both me and my wife, using only one user name.  I could see that this app might be a little clumsy for establishing an account, but once an account was established on line, I don't foresee problems using this app for day-to-day activities.   I took off a star because, unlike my other pharmacy app, this one seems to only addresses Rx products, and does not allow one to check out the price and availability of nonprescription products at their local drugstores.""Ridiculous! Better off with email. This app shows far less information than their website, and you have to log in every time you access it, which means you don't get updates about your orders. So why even use it?""App does not work, will not show any of my information,  useless!""The only thing it lets me do is login. None of the buttons work, can't pull up my cards, find pharmacies, or anything else. The only thing that works is login and logout. Deleting it off my phone.""What is the point of displaying your id card as an option in the app when it only displays a generic card. The pharmacies can not do anything with that and will not fill scripts without the proper info. It is as bad as the print option of a sample card. Again, what a waste and inconvenience.""Doesn't work half the time,  can't see your family's account information,  but it's what my work offers so have to use it   Devs,  have you used the software you created? Give that Shot before turning out poor applications.""Accounts won't connect.""Needed to submit on another site! All I wanted was to use my phone to snap my prescription for order, not sign up for a data eating app""Very slow and clunky""I don't think people realise that buttons become unusable if you're not logged in to your account. Which for security you have to sign back in every time you open the app. Only 4 stars because sign is isn't prompted upon opening the app but everything has worked smoothly for me""How can I do ANYTHING when I can't even get the keyboard to pull up to type in my password?? Why can't I click on ANY buttons?? What's the point of this app if it's completely unusable? It's been long  enough, fix the crap already.""I downloaded the app to get my I.D cards, the buttons don't work in the app so again, what's the point in getting this app if I can't click on the button that say I.D card.""When I used this app to submit a prescription renewal request, I later got a call from CVS to inform me I had to also mail them the paper prescription!  I have deleted the app now!""Won't even let me put in my username.  There is a red \"x\" as it thinks my username is incorrect.  Worked a few months back, but have tried several times since then to no avail.  Needs removed from the store.""Downloaded this app so I could quickly setup a mail order. But I can barely do anything in the app because most buttons don't do anything when clicked. Tried to go to the mobile web version but that doesn't allow you to setup new mail orders. I don't currently have a desktop so how am I supposed to order my medicine???""Was unable to create an account after numerous tries!!#!""Used to have prescriptions filled by Walgreens and was a snap. This monstrosity doesn't recognize my CVS/caremark card or my extracare pharmacy card. Doing data entry on my phone with isn't fun. Probably better off just going to the pharmacy  (it's close to me) and getting a simple text notification is the lowbrow tech, but much easier option.""Why in the world would you need access to my WiFi information""There's some issue with my account that if I try to use the app for prescriptions, I have to input my information all anew - and then it tells me my info is already associated with another account. The actually pharmacy says it's an online problem & to fix it with them. The online support says it's a store problem & to fix it with them.  Thanks.  :/""Many functions of the app do not work. Order Status never loads any data. View Rx History is blank no matter what date range I use.""Installed, logged in to get my drug history and wouldn't work.  Security issues with Internet, but it's an app and I can't do anything about the internet versions on my phone.  What a waste.""Pharmacy location feature inaccurate.  When entering my zip code the locator says nothing found, but changing search radius to 20 miles finds my local pharmacy more than 16 miles away. The pharmacy is less than 6 miles away and is in the same zip code as me. My preferred pharmacy can't be saved so I have to go through that stupid worthless search every time I need to price an Rx or to check coverage under my plan. Frequent crashes at app startup.  You're better off just getting on their website with a PC.""Everytime I try to log in it takes forever to load and finally just tells me wrong user name or password. I know it is correct because I can log in on a PC just fine""I can't even sign in. It won't let me put my password in so it's absolutely useless.""Everything I try to log in I'm told my password username is incorrect.  I try to get a password reset and it tells me my username is incorrect. Every single time. It's not incorrect since I can reset my password via the website however I want to use the app for convenience.  Very annoying. Not happy with it.""Working OK before update. No longer can sign in. Every time I sign in with my username, there is a red X. Delete and reinstall. Turn off the phone and restart, doesn't work anymore. The app takes up too much storage space. Slow and poorly written. Android 6.0.1""I just used this app for the first time. It was the easiest procedure I've ever used for refilling a precription. I used the scanning function, confirmed the information presented to me and it was done.  It probably took 3-4 minutes including the scanning. Great job!""Useless. Ever time I try to use this app I end up reseting by password.  App is so slow I can actually drive to the local cvs faster.""It would seem that CVS finally woke up and tried fix this app. Now, only 1 out of the 7 perscriptions I have with them is showing up. First the app would not work on my phone; now it works and the information is wrong?? What's up CVS?.....DUH!!!!!""After latest update says my prescription account does not allow use of mobile app???""The icons cannot be tapped on.  I can type in my password and use the go button on the keyboard to login but I can't tap the sign in icon and I can't tap any icons in the app except the submit a new rx icon.  I've restarted my phone (galaxy note 3) several times and all other apps work just fine.  Very disappointing""What gives? The app won't even start up. Pretty silly for a company like CVS to make such a crappy app. And they even send emails to ask using their app. You need a better tech team and QA.""Opened the app, went to make an account, and it crashed. I was trying to use this app as a lite version of the horribly bulky CVS store app, but it failed too.""Order is free. Shipping is free. Total is 0. So why they need our  Credit card for?  for free order???  Smell like a scam to me.""Should be no stars but as the rating requires stars ..... App did not like my samsung note 4 edge downloaded over wifi then when opening said app  stated \"no network connection\". i take that as a \" will not work unless we use your data plan\" if third time is a charm ...well never made it and  twice was trying enough""Clumsy, forgets your password, times you out before you are done looking up drugs, forgets the store you want to use during searches, Sometimes not even moving when you press the search button. Cannot lookup generics! You have to search by brand name and then you can only get the brand name price. Entering desired dosage and number of days is cumbersome and slow. The pharmacists can't stand it. It is faster to call the pharmacy, give your info and have them run it for you.""Keeps saying \"Connection failed, please check your network and try again.\" I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, but still gives me the same network error. Please fix! I tried picking up a prescription at a new pharmacy and they need my card. This app used to be very convenient with having that info readily available for me.""Can't sign in. All troubleshooting ever says is to call the 800 number. App is useless. Just mail me my prescription card and be done with it!""Says network problem and have wifi and unlimited data still won't let me in after deleting and redownloading app""Works but slow speed makes it almost useless and is likely the cause of most of its low ratings.""Since updating to this version the app keeps stalling and freezing forcing me to force quit it. It was working fine before and all of a sudden with this latest update I can't get my card to show up to even see what coupons are on it. Thanks for breaking an otherwise adequate app.""Tried two different CVS apps can't get past the creation of the account. Won't accept my birthday. And says there was an Network error try again later. Nope not messing with it.""Quick scan QR code will not work. Keep getting server errors when trying to manually enter the refill #. Took a week just to refill my prescription.

Trying to install it again""First it gave me my username, then when resetting the password, says it doesn't recognize my username. I had to call them to fix it. Now I can't refill prescriptions or check prices because it gives an error message and says to call the 800# again. Smh""The stupid security questions that are asked just to sign up with an app is absolutely ridiculous!!""Worthless. Have my prescriptions filled at Target CVS and they never show up.  View prescription card and I get error try again later.""Trying to refill my medications, can mot update credit card information. Also medication prices always changing.""The cvs i use has the cheapest bottles and labels. The bar code and Rx# is wore off after general handling and it takes a vice grip to get the tops off.  This app could not read the bar code at all. So i ditched it.""Unfortunately  the  app will  not  load  on  my  new  GS7 Edge running 6.01. I did  send  an  email to the feedback address worth  software  and  hardware  information and  will  change  my  rating  once  the  issue  is  fixed.  The  app worked  flawlessly  on  my  GS5.""I registered and refilled my prescription in less than 5 minutes! This app is super easy to use and extremely  convenient if I leave my card at home. Love this app!""Can't paste into the user name and password. How am I  supposed to use a complex and secure password?  Guess I have to use something simple enough to memorize.""I can't figure find app for deals.  I have a card, but can't get special coupons advertise for app.  Which app do u use.  Store employees wrong on which one""    ""com.contacts1800.ecomapp"":     ""App doesn't let you delete old RX, addresses, or any basic information that might be outdated. I also have a problem with my RX constantly needing to be verified even if I've already uploaded it and ordered contacts a month ago. So while the process to order is easy there is definitely room for improvement.""I like the credit card photo capture along with the script photo. Makes it easy.""It took me just over 2 minutes to change addresses, change my prescription, and order my new contacts with this app. It also let me take a picture of the prescription for proof rather than having to validate from the eye doctor's office. I would highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a quick and easy way to order or reorder contacts, especially those with extremely busy schedules and little time to sit down for 15 minutes at a computer to do it.""Couldnt add coupon from app. Also, its my damn choice whether or not to use a browser or the app. You send me emails with a redirect to the app store.""Really easy to order new lenses. however, I didn't see any place to enter a code for a coupon/discount""Convenient way to reorder contacts. Can't put promo or coupon code in the app.""Super easy to use!!! Waiting on 5-7 business day shipping. Update coming soon...""The 1 800 contacts makes ordering so easy and fast. It saves all of your information after the first order so you don't have to go through a long process every time. Sign in, reorder, done. That easy!""Easy to use. Secure and fast ! Love it""This site was super easy to use except I made a mistake with I care provider and had a hard time changing the information. But once I figured out how it was easy again.""Giordano and the password is going to pick them up just in case you can spread jelly girl would be ok too corren the kids""Other not being able to apply my shipping code for free expedited shipping, because there's no way to add codes on the app. It worked ok""Simple and easy, just the way we like transacting business in today's digital age.""Great experience overall! Definitely recommend. You can use your phone camera to scan the barcode on your current box of contacts, upload pictures of your prescription and your payment card. It's much simpler that entering the information in by hand.""I have to applaud this company's customer service line as I am very impressed by it. After submitting my order through the app (took 5 minutes), I got an email that said they had an issue with my prescription and gave me a number to call. I was surprised when my call was answered not only by a real person but she already knew who I was and needed only my address to confirm who I was. She looked up the issue and I was able to clear with her the confusion about my prescription, and confirmed that my order would be shipped the next day. It was a very pleasant experience that took less than ten minutes and this is coming from someone who hates calling customer service.""Worked flawlessly, easily re-ordered contacts. App automatically added in several discounts, I didn't even have to put in a code.""This app did not have correct information on tracking and did not work in general functions.""    ""com.cube.arc.blood"":     ""I've tried innumerable times to log in and failed.  Rcvd email with new PW. Fail. Tried a second email PW. Fail""This app never has accurate information with regard to my donation history. I do like being able to schedule donation appointments on it though and completing the fastpass before the appointment saves a little bit of time""1. Needs a Contact Us section. In trying to correct errors, there is a place to fill out your info--but not a box to describe what the error is!  2. The \"Blood Journey\" isn't specific for my blood's particular journey. It's just a general description of the process; and  3. the Donation Scheduler (and searching for a donation site) is so difficult to use. The graphics, however, are very, very nice. I like how the donor card is in the app.  Since I already know the donation dates for my Church for the year, can't I just go ahead and make all those appts.? It's much more convenient instead of within 2 weeks.""Ive tried several times to link my donor information, but it never happens. The app is pretty much only good for scheduling which you can do online already.""Easy to use, very informative""Why notify me and ask to schedule an appointment before I am eligible. You only find out your not eligible until you complete the appointment.  Also the local volunteers information is not insynk with websites infor. Need better organization.""Looks like it will be good, but doesn't allow me to set up from donor card.""The app is really great for finding blood drives and it's nice to be able to have my donor card easily available.   I have had problems with the in app rapid pass. I've used it twice and both times the Red Cross person said it had the wrong date. I brought along the print out and that on works, so I guess I'll just do that until the rapid pass gets fixed.   I really like the blood tracking feature, I enjoy seeing where my blood went.""It is awesome. I can book donation appointments and have all my information right there.""Informative and easy to use""Wonderful app!!!  I can schedule an appointment and complete rapid pass very quickly.  Love all the educational  information.""Very nice to have an electronic donor card and complete rapid pass from my mobile device.  Would be nice to have rapid pass QR code saved within the APP itself.""I should be able to search for just 1 day and not today or a 14 day window. Also,  the rapid pass doesn't load even with full 4G data.""Very easy to use and has all the information I could need!""The app is getting better,  much appreciated. But the rewards are getting worse. The new rewards were made by someone who cannot figure out antialiasing - how pathetic!  The scheduler teaches me arrogantly about the difference between software and hardware arrows instead of just getting me to the previous page. Or maybe it could ask me what I want?  How hard is it to make a separate button for eligibility instead of hiding it under donation history? Eligibility is not history! Surprise, surprise! There is _another_ donation history with vital signs under \"Donor Card\".  Donations are measured is units, lives and gallons - three ways! I don't see the value of donation types in those units. A platelet donation \"saves\" 3 or 6 \"lives\" inconsistently.  The whole notion of using \"lives\" as a score to measure the impact is disrespectful to the human life. To make the matter worse, the lives saved by teams are rounded to thousands. The 207 \"lives\" \"saved\" by me are just a rounding error for my team. Yet a loss of 207 actual lives would have been in the headlines for days if not weeks.""My information can not be found. I called the number they directed me too and no help. \ud83d\ude10""Im sure ot would be good but i did donate blood at 16 so why does it say 17? Please fix i was emailed by you guys telling my my donation is being shopped but i wany to find out who im helping""This app would be perfect if I could take the EZ-Pass questionaire from within it and be able to pull up the QR code at the same time as my donor card.""Very informative, easy to use, up to date, great app.""Disappointed that blood journey isnt working.  Booked appt thru app, scanned donor card at donation site, got an email re journey. App still shows nothing.""It won't let me create an account because I'm 16. But I donated and I have my donor card.""I thoroughly enjoy donating and watching my donation's journey.  This app is so helpful for that and more. My donation history, my ID card, blood type info and much more. AWESOME! THANKS!""Just got my information about my donation in the mail. Wanted to get my donor card and see when the next time I could donate would be. Turns put you have to be 17 to login to the app. They should ask the for your state so they can check laws first. Really kinda burned out my excitement to see where my donation went""It generally works well. Give them 48 hours to upload your information.""Lousy. Red Cross can't manage to load my donor card after having over 40 years!""Nice app for scheduling. I would likento see access to Rapid Pass with ability to have the resulting QR code.""It is very important app for every mobile phone because everyone want blood""I downloaded last month after giving blood....and just have a couple of days ago, and this app has never updated with my info.  I received my donor card in the mail last month, but the app is useless to me.  Went through the process many times to get updated by submitting my info and donor ID, no go.""Stop forcing people to give up personal information from their phones. I want to help but not at the expense of my privacy.""Very helpful with scheduling appointments. I also love how informative it is! It even keeps my \"wellness check\" information for me!\ud83d\ude00""Been 3 weeks and still my information hasn't been updated on the app.""Convenient. Doesn't let you see the journey though. I still get email saying where it was used.""It's as helpful as the donor card. I wish the Rapid Pass was an option on this. If it is, I couldn't find it.""I'm a little annoyed, I received an email with my donor card but for whatever reason it won't sync with the app, I have gone to my profile and requested an update twice and yet it still won't show my information. The main reason I want this app is so I can have my donor card handy but since that isn't happening I don't see the point in keeping it.""Great app! Very informative, interesting info that is easy to use!""Too slow to update donation info""So easy to use. I like see the journey of the donation. I don't always carry my card so it's nice it on the app just in case someone needs to know my blood type in case of emergency. Awesome to have :)""App is easy to use. Useful and interesting information.""It's been half a week, none of my donation information is uploaded. Nothing from my appointment is up, my information, anything. How long does it usually take?""It wont let me upload my doner card. Wont give me credit to past donations and doesnt help keep track of appointments.    Seriously was looking forward to it so I emailed three times. No response. Im chucking it up as they are busy for the hurricane so ill continue to donate my blood but it sucks this is happening""Installed hoping for RapidPass capability to streamline the donation process. Not present so Uninstall.  Update: Checking back to see if it's better now. Why do you need access to my Contacts? Excessive IMO so I won't reinstall.""ADD RAPID PASS! Using the link via email always gives me issues.""Donation data missing""Needs lots of work it does not keep updated information updated in whenever you donate blood it does not show that you donated it never hardly ever is available for updates and no updates are usually available to update it to make it better need lots of work but other than that very good idea""I found the app easy to use and it contains a lot of useful and interesting information!""I can't add my donor card id. I can't update the app at all. This app is useless. I don't want to email my information so they can ignore it. Awful app.""This is literally the dumbest app ever. You can't link anything, there is an error code to every single piece of information you try to put in, and you cannot add your Donor ID later on. Seriously a waste of time.""I like the app for being able to access my donor card, make appointments and retain the location of my local Red Cross, reschedule or cancel appointments, check my donation history, and see my blood type. What I don't like is that every time I try to retrieve the rewards given to me, something goes wrong and the access to them disappears. The latest message: Update the app to claim your reward. I did and the rewards are gone.""So I filled out all of my information but when I get to the donor ID part it always says error HELP??""I think this apps represents an AWESOME group of people that want to help save lives. This app personally tells me a lot of knowledgeable information. Definitely recommend downloading if you're a blood donor""Wow so much has improved in this app since the last time I used it back in 2014 thanks for the improvements""I love this app and i love donating. I just wish my donation history and personal things would come back. I havent been able to see any of that since i redownloaded the app and i put in my card and everything :/""Great app. Has good information . Get your blood type and units donated , keeps track of everything.""Very helpful. Tells you when your appointment is, blood type, tips, donor card and steps of how the donation will go.""Love the app!  No need to have my donor card, and I can track how many donations I've had.  Especially like that it tells where my blood is within the process, and where it ends up.  Also like the team-building capacity and social media sharing built into it.""Needs to give location information about drive locations, such as if the donation area is within a building, where in the building, if it's in the bloodmobile, etc. Confirmation emails give this information, so it should be doable for the app. If the app is updated to include this or even to search filter for bloodmobile drives, I'll bump this up to 5 stars.""Very informative!""I have donated 18 times. I love saving lives. My life was saved so I'm giving back.""Great app! So easy to use and lots of great information""Very easy to use and very informative!""So handy and full of great information""App is helpful and informative. Very convenient when it's time to donate blood.""I would like to see you add the Rapid Pass option to the app & incorporate it with someone\u200b's information on their phone. Make this as easy as possible for people trying to make a donation!""Took a bit for my donation tonlink to my account but now its working good, it helps me keep track of past and future donations. I love it!""While the app now allows you to enter your blood pressure, it only allows you to enter it on the day of the reading. There is apparently no way to enter past values, or enter a value even on the day after the reading. Please update to address this. Also, I would like the donor ID card to include my bar code so I can stop carrying around my physical card.""Very informative""Very well made and informative app""My son donated blood and received his donor card. Tried to set up his account on this app but it says he isn't old enough to donate.  This app was not thought out well.""This app is great! It speeds up the donation process by giving me an e-donor card and helps me manage my appointments and know when to donate""The initial sign up for a new account  process is broken""Very useful for finding places to give and even keeps your donation card so you don't have to remember it!""Doesn't let me create an account, tried four different email addresses and usernames.  What a waste of my time.""So user friendly and it includes all information I need.""After donating blood and recieving a donor card, I decided to download the application.  When I attempted to make an account, it told me that I was not old enough to donate, despite the fact that I evidently was, being as how I had ready freaking made a blood donation.""Easy to use, a lot of helpful information about everything.""I really like this app and the fact that I can move it to my sdcard to free up space on my phone is a definite plus, however, I recently noticed that after an update to the app it defaulted back to storage on my phone. Can you please fix that? I hate having to keep moving it back.""I love working with the red cross! They have excellent staff who are funny n yet sensitive to your needs. The volunteers are helpful n friendly. They've even called me to tell me that my blood donation helped save a man's life in a car accident in Salem. That's awesome! :-)""App is so easy for making appointments.  But please stop calling and emailing me weekly when i am not eligible to donate for 2 months. You have to know when i am eligible.  Bother me then.""I love all the information and being able to see a record of my physical findings""So far it's just taking up memory... red Cross website wouldn't recognize my donor ID so I didn't input it in to this app in the beginning and now I can't update it, it's the only thing on my info that I can't edit.  It doesn't bring up any donor history or my visit from 2 weeks ago even though it said it would update w/in 48 hours, I even sent a message in the app and still no one contacted me or updated my info on the app.""Good but wish they could go back and update previous donations""My information has never been updated in the app. I have filled out the form for wrong information and still, nothing. Was of space on my phone.""Super helpful. Love the built-in donor card.""I couldn't even sign up. I tried every combination I could think of for a username (even just random numbers and letters) yet I was still unable to create an account due to an error that states that my username is already taken. And yes, I checked every time to make sure that it said username and not email.""8.5/10  Pros: Nice layout, user friendly for the most part, it found my donation history from 9+ years ago (the last time I gave blood, prior to 2 months ago) ((my wallet/purse was stolen \ud83d\ude2d a few years back)) appointments tell you when you can donate platelets, double red, and regular red (times), specific addresses to your location and distance from you.  Cons: It does not like when you have to cancel your appointment. I even got a few emails. No big deal. You can only search for appointments using 1or 2 certain criteria(s). It y.ells at you to hit the back button on your phone instead of in the app if you want to go back a page. You can't search for appointments further away than a month or two.""Love the information available on the app.  Great that my Donor card is stored on the app. Now I will not forget it anymore.""I have donated blood for 50 years. I have had email logins for 10 years. This app let me create a new account with my old email. Where is their security??? Red Cross can rent Mira Lago from Trump for bigly dollars... I'm ashamed of such indulgence with donations.""No phone numbers, app closes when you back out of your blood journey""Informative & easy to use.""Terrific app! It has improved greatly. Allot more information for the user and more user friendly.""Mobile Rapid Pass please!!!!!""I think it's cool. I would like to see a more clear description of where to find your donor ID, or an image of the card underlining what it needs from it (like with credit cards online sometimes) but otherwise so far it's a better way to track it then the card I have.""Would be nice to be able to complete the rapid pass information directly from the app. Otherwise it's good""I'm 16 years old but I donated at my school with parental consent. I got my donor card and ID but I can't sign up since I'm not 17. Please help.""The app had great information about where to donate.""I love not having to bring my card every time or trying to find it I just have my card on my phone.""I would recommend this application because it gives the user a lot of information, which he can then use to better prepare his mind and body for the blood donation process.""Supposed to be able to fill out forms here to save time. Can't find that feature. Out of sync password with web app.""Nice to be able to quickly look up your information.  I would like to see the Rapid pass added to the app.""I would like the app to show my blood pressure history. That was very useful with the cards. I find navigation tricky in this app. You get stuck in an area and it's difficult to get home. I'd also like to be able to enter non-Red Cross donations to make scheduling easier.""    ""com.carezone.caredroid.careapp.medications"":     ""I am a tracker by nature, especially medical information. Joining was a no-brainer. Works well for me.""This app is amazing. It helps me with my medication, after a heart attack and stroke I tend to forget sometimes. Thank you from the bottom of my broking little heart.""Well first I thought this was a local companies. The app tells you to submit your prescriptions,via scanner,upload your image and Health Provider. Then they offer you some vitamins,for free,and after 30 days it would be $29.99. All of that np,but the moment this company finds out my insurance doesn't cover their services. Instead of transferring back my prescriptions,I'm told by my pharmacist in Portland,Or,that sorry we can't field your prescription because it's in \"Tennessee\". So now I'm having to have all my prescriptions transferred back from this dumb company. If ones insurance isn't covered,wouldn't you'd think it would be a good idea that the people's prescriptions you hijacked without first making sure our insurance covered your service. To maybe send back out original prescriptions? Thanks for making my doctor think I was sending my scripts to Tennessee,when I'm 2,100 miles away.""I love this app. Keeps me informed and able to give this to my doctor for issues. Please keep up the great work. I even shared the website on my fbook!!""After two strokes, my  memory was also left significantly impaired. I really needed this app! I will never forget my life saving meds again, THANK YOU!! *FEB.2013 ADDITIONAL INFO= This isn't just a app... CareZone it is a MUST for myself. Keeps Blood Sugar records literally at my fingertips. CareZone's name says it ALL. It does all & more for me! Having been recently released from ICU & diagnosed with Diabetic Ketoacidosis Idk what I would have done w/out this app to aid me along. I've told all of my family about CareZone. I have even told complete stranger's in the docs office about this app. It's SO easy to use! I will continue to spread the word about CareZone bc it  has been nothing short of a Godsend to me... a app is literally helping to keep me alive, wow! Kudos \u00d7100 to the developer's & thanks you for the kind words!""What a great idea! All my medical information in one place and a reminder as well! Besides, who goes anywhere without their phone? I'd recommend this to anyone with a medical condition!""This is NOT just a way to keep a list of your medications. It is an online pharmacy. The services they offer might be helpful to others but not for me. I think its important that people know what theyvare signing up for! By scanning my prescription bottles I foolishly gave them all kinds of information . Who knows what they will do with it?! I already have an online pharmacy, approved by my insurance company. I don't need another one.""I can't stop this app from emailing me CONSTANTLY. I needed a medication list; not a constant spammer.""I love having the information at my fingertips  when calling my husband's doctors I could look up nearly everything they wanted to know. I do wish I could email the data to the doctors.""Doesn't work. Won't let me log in. Continuously get \"failed to load user information\".""App is horrible. It won't open and their website won't open. Had to turn off notifications because they barrage you with ads and and emails. Annoying to say the least. Good riddance""Secure this is here to help in needs""I'm trying 2 sighn back into care zone pharmacy delivery""I love having all the information in one area as well as the daily rx reminders!""Excellent reminders for busy people like me that sometime forget their meds. Also, in an emergency you have all of your information at hand. Treatment center, insurance information, PCP contact info, medications and POC's. Very well put together and thought out.""The app is good, I like the features, but it has started with these pop up ads on my phone that link back to Google Play to download an app I've already got. Very annoying.""I've used this app a few days. I like it & it's helpful but today it will not let me login in. I keep getting 'failed to load user information' & it brings me back to sign in.""Great way to track your medication as well as other pertinent information about your health.""Great services but I currently have no prescriptions anymore and would like to delete my account but I am having problems with doing so. Every time I go to delete my account the button to do so does not work and I have even tried going to the browser with no luck.""This is one of the most helpful and user-friendly personal medical data organizers I have used to date. So convenient to have all of my data easily available when I am visiting a new physician's office. Great job, developers! \u263a Also I am very impressed with the responsiveness of the support team. A great Rep replied to my email for assistance within an hour of my request for assistance. The advice Dan sent allowed me to access my information after a system update to my phone rendered my original log-in unusable. 5 STARS! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d""I think this app is very helpful tool to help me keep everything organized and to have at my fingertips. Also, if something happens to me my friends and family will know where to go to get my medical information; Insurance plans, Alergies, Health Issues, Blood Type and Medications I take. It will be very helpful in any medical/ emergency for anyone even myself. No digging in the person or wallet necessary, Nice \u263a""AWESOME!!!\ud83d\ude03I just reinstalled & thank you for adjusting app to move to ext.SD card & save 65mb!

Yay!""Being a retired Paramedic with health issues makes keeping up with current meds and doses a snap. This makes it easy for  health professionals to take the information and plan the best treatment options for you. Best I've used thus far. Don't  like the ads on using their RX service though.""Keeps up with day to day with the reminders, makes you more accountable to yourself.""Downloaded app to keep my meds in an easy place to view.  Keep getting reminders to refill and emails.  A real pain in the a**.  I deleted this app months ago keep getting emails stop sending me f***king emails.""I have a bad memory and it really helps me keep track of my medications thank you""It's an amazing, useful app that collects important information about your health and allows you to share that I do with important people. I was in a situation which I didn't have access to my meds and my family didn't know which ones they needed to bring new and which were PRN. Now they all have a list of my meds, my meds schedule and a wallet card....including my allergies list.....all features of Care Zone!   I love the RX product which sends your daily meds monthly in small dosage packs, already sorted and ready to take.  I am very forgetful and sometimes may miss a dose. The convenient packs will replace having a big pill sorter.   I can choose which meds I like them to manage and which meds I will keep at my local pharmacy.  At first, I thought there was a catch or they were selling something or they wanted me to switch to them all together....not the case at all!  The app is pretty easy to use but if you run into trouble a rep will walk you through it....the customer service is warm and welcoming.   Glad I came in contact with Care Zone. Loving this!""I'm unable to cancel the account even though they have a link. I've seen over 50 people on a comment page just in the last couple days who also want to cancel but haven't been able to either.  DON'T USE THIS APP.""Great way to stay organized with all the correct information.""It would be nice to have a main  section for surgeries and the reason, also disorders or diseases. Doctors always need  that information.""I haven't used all of the services that CareZone offers but what I am using works great. I have used:  1) scanner to scan my meds. 2) reminder to take meds 4) reminder to refill meds 5) scan health care cards (l haven't scanned my Medicare card, that's giving out too much info) There is a lot of useful information u can put on the CareZone's app. Any info you need to give to your doctor would be on CareZone's app.  Cons: I haven't put a lot of personal info on the app because I haven't seen where I can secure the information wth a password or pin number.""I haven't been using this app very long but so far I like it! So far the only draw back I can see is that I would like more customizable settings for the reminders.  I would really like to be able to customize the sound or vibratu on it makes. Mostly to differentiate between other notifications or notifications on my phone.  Also it would be nice to have a setting such as remind to take every 4, 6, or 8 etc hours.""Excellent app for keeping all my important medical information in one easy, convenient place. Outstanding customer service as well.""I hated this app two days after I installed it and   I been trying to delete and remove this dam stupid app FOR the past one year and keeps on coming back I wrote the them to be removed still they never did. So please do not install it .""It's easy to use and is a great help in managing my medications. I like how I don't forget to take my meds anymore or wonder if I already took them. However, I still find it quite lacking. I wish that the pain tracker was more specific: including what part of the body, what kind of pain it was, etc. Also, it'd be nice to include more trackers for common symptoms like cough, allergies, sore throat and flu. Even a customizable tracker would be awesome. The journal could use a little improvement as well. I wish we were given the option to edit an entry and to choose what type of entry (e.g., side effects, health events, etc.) to make so there'll be less typing. Overall, though, I'm happy with it.  Edit: The calendar says I missed taking my meds when I only changed the time I set to take them and suddenly the list of meds I was scheduled to take is doubled (one for the time I actually took them and the other after I edited the time I wanna take them). And it also says I missed the morning/afternoon doses of one of my meds when I only just added it and just started to take it that night. It's incredibly frustrating and confusing when I go back and check my calendar and see that I missed taking meds when I really didn't. Please do something about this, thank you.""Scanning my medication & having the list together in one place at all times is so convenient. I'm pretty sure the other features Care Zone has to offer are just as convenient for whatever your medical need may be. Care Zone is a good app to have & us. It is very reliable when you need your medical information close at hand. Thank You Very Much Care Zone.""The simplicity of CareZone is fantastic. I truly love the fact that it's able to keep all my medical information in one place. It's easy to utilize.""Love EVERYTHING about the app, but I do wish there was an EASY way to send my medical cards to a medical provider directly from the app.   What's the point of having my medical cards electronically if I cannot send them out via MMS or email to a provider?   Currently I have to take a screenshot of the images of my medical cards and then email them to the provider.. It would be nice if I could do that from the app..""Like the multiple profile setup, I have my wife's on it as well as mine. Great way to keep track of her meds. Update: was really helpful when she had her heart attack, opened the app and gave to the er staff.""It's easier to show my med list to the doctors from my phone, I can put my Dr appointment on here & get reminder, my insurance card as well  The reminder to take my meds I luv the most. I can keep up with my vitals on here as well. Pretty much every thing you need for your Dr appointment""I liked the app. A little annoying it displays Medicare stuff a lot, but understandable. Problem now is it won't open. It was asking for my password, so I typed it in and it scrolls than say can't load owners information. Uninstalled it and re-installed it. Samething. I don't  know if they did an update that messed it up or what. Would like it fixed or I will load a different app for medication tracking.""So great to have a list of my meds plus dosage ect. My insurance &  ID card, all my info. in one easy app. The ER Dr was very impressed with it .. now I don't  have to try to remember what meds or dosage I take.""Especially with it's bar code reader""This app is such a handy tool for keeping information you always forget to bring when you see your doctors. It also serves as a reminder to take your medicine day or night. I've shown many people right in the office, demonstrating all of it's features!""This app is SO useful.  I take a lot of meds, and see a variety of doctors.  I'm constantly in need of my medication list for specialists or to update for my regular physicians.  I could neve remember all of my meds before I found this app.  It also allows me to keep taxi of my husbands medications, which is awesome, since he has the memory of a fly.""Very handy to document meds and vitamins so you have all the information in one place.""Great App! It list all the information I need when I go for a Dr.s appointment.""&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Can no longer sign in. Attempts cause app to stop.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  It would be more helpful to me if the future doses background were more obvious. I just checked the Take All buttons thinking they were yesterday's missed doses. Then had to go back and individually uncheck them all. I do like the idea of their pharmacy's individually packaged doses. I'm thinking of starting with them after I move away from my friendly locally owned pharmacy.""Still some Minor things to to work out. Maybe add procedures and or Surgeries. Works perfect gathering information from prescription labels.""Great information and easy to use.""Keeps my medication list, insurance information, & everything at my fingertips. Reminds me what doctor prescribes what & when to refill it. I never forget to take my meds!""I'm using this app to manage my grandparents health and it is so handy, user friendly, and informative. Please add a section for notes in the trackers. Especially the blood glucose, I like to take notes of what she has eaten, her mood, etc. to better manage her diabetes.""This program has several critical flaws.  -It automatically adds reminder timers whenever you add something.  There is no option to change this behavior.  -It keeps prompting you to enroll in their mail order pharmacy.  There is not a way to tell it no permanently.  This means I have to wait for this screen to load, and click to close it, every time I start it.  -My information on doctors, meds, etc transferred to my new device, but not my vitals.""Wouldn't let me create account. \"sign in using AARP Medications App. Which isn't in the app store.""It would could've been so much better, if it wasn't a requirement to scan in your ID/DL to \"register\" a profile, especially when you're attempting to keep track of your family medications-- I wasn't able to add my child's profile due to the ID requirement.   Although, it's a helpful app, it does remind you when to take/need a refill for your medication, but the process to add a medication to your profile, proves a bit tedious. I completely understand that their process to add in a medication is to ensure that all the important information is correctly input, but it's slightly tedious when you have a large amount of medications to add. It allows you to track different aspects of your health, which is great for people who have chronic health conditions that require consistent monitoring.""This app makes taking my meds and recording data throughout my days so much more simple. A+++ 5****""I'm able to keep loads of medical information at my fingertips. That really comes in handy at doctor appointments.""Great for reminding me to take my meds, a person can get busy and forget. All my pill information available when needed, great tool.""It needs to add some sort of persistence. When I swipe away a pop-up, that should set it to snooze and remind me again later at least another time if not more. Scanning meds in was nice but I haven't taken my meds with any regularity since I added this app. I'm going back to the app I had on my old phone (Medisafe) even though I have to type in each medication. It's annoying in it's persistence which is what I need.""I have a short term memory problem. I can never remember what my meds are. Now I have them handy all the time. Great!""    ""ru.mobiledimension.kbr"":     ""Very informative.""Very useful, very informative. I love it, even with ads, it didn't make much difference to me.""I just found out I was pregnant a few days ago and have been trying out various pregnancy apps. This one is the worst I've found so far. The entire site reads like it was mistranslated through Babelfish. It also contains some disturbingly sexist language (referring to women as \"the fair sex,\" for example), calling some \"hypochondriacs\" for having early symptoms, etc. When I tried to submit feedback about this language, it directed me to an email address in RUSSIA!! Yikes!""Useful app, very informative.""Love it! Very informational and full of details!!""Beautiful App Just love how informative this app is...I would recommend it\ud83d\udcaf""I love this app ....g\u00f2od information""Detailed and informative! I really enjoyed it during my pregnancy!""Had to go back to other one from before. I like the daily information and hints.""Great.  Very informative. Useful.""Super app! I love it soo much, very useful and informative""Throughout the pregnancy period of my wife, we got lots of knowledge from this app that sometimes people do wrong things due to lack of knowledge or superstition. This app was good for all our queries. We got our princes 5 days back. A little happy family now....""Has alot of good information for moms to be! :)""Very informative tells you about every step of the way.""Bizarre information that looks like it was translated to English by a machine.  Many pop up ads.""It wasn't as informative as I thought, also gave incorrect advice. I didn't like the user interface""Lots of bad information. I had this on my phone and all of my wife's doctors thought her pregnancy pointed out things this app said that is wrong and bad""Reckless medical advice contained in this app. Do not listen to the information in this app. Consult your doctor and do not stop taking prescribed medication because of the false information contained here.""Informative""Very informative""Very informative""It is very informative and helpful for moms to be. It helps us get insights of our baby's development inside our womb.""I didn't read all of the information but what I did was wrong. \"If your job requires lifting then think about maternity\" this is incorrect. I found this on the gov website maybe you could use to give people correct information  \"When there are risks in working environment the employer should take steps to remove them. If the risk cannot be removed or a suitable alternative job be found, the employer should suspend the employee on full pay.\"  Also what a load of rubbish to say \"find a man to help with lifting\"  Please review your out of date information.""Easy to use, a lot of great technical information. This is my second pregnancy and I'm enjoying this app more than the other one I used last time.""Good app and good information for the pregnant mother.""Full of tips and a lot of informations for first mom to be""This app has so many tabs of different information and I love it!""Good information""Sound medical information""Useful,  informative, educative""Lots of information and easy to use. Only annoyance is the sentences don't always make sense grammatically.""Helpful and informative""Great app very informative for first time moms uses a lot of medical terms we wouldn't understand tho I have to google alot""OK hood information""Really good app so far I love that it tells you what to expect and helpful tips. The only thing affecting the credibility for me are all of the typos especially with such a sensitive topic, you may want to proof read your information.""Good information""Very informative and easy to use app.""Informative""I really like this app. It has more information for me than using google.""very informative application""Love this app very informative!!""    ""com.mysugr.android.companion"":     ""Great app for tracking otherwise I don't track information""Very easy to use and I like the emails we get as users to reinforce use of the app""I loved this app until they wanted to charge me a subscription fee just to export the data so I could send it to my doctor.""Great app for tracking insulin, meals, exercise, etc all in one place.  Works with the Accu-Chek connect series or you can do manual entry of glucose levels.  Even works with location data, though that could be improved as it tends to select the last restaurant in a half mile area instead of the one you're right on top of.""Way easy to use. Easy to go back and review your levels. Love it.""Best app to keep me accountable! Easy to use & has everything I need.""Initially looked very complex, but is in fact very easy to use. Very likeable and intuitive interface. Your entered diabetic data is presented in a analytical format that makes one want to strive  for better control.""Great app, but doesn't offer choice for data before breakfast which is when I check my blood eash day.""Amazingly helpful, easy to use and outstanding customer support/follow-up. I really like that I can both enter and track data on any device...phone, tablet and computer...and the user-friendly information layout and color coding, as well as food logs, etc. are great tools for me as well as my doctors (the only thing I would change is to eliminate the automatic averaging function when readings fall into the same one-hour timeblock...especially when sugar levels are very low and then spike, the average is not a good representation of key inputs). Another benefit is that I can have important data anytime, even if my glucometer is not nearby. Absolutely invaluable and all-around great...a must have for anyone who needs to track glucose levels!""The best alternative to writing down on a physical log/diary. Just a quick type, clicks here and there to indicate what meals/activities you are doing. Decided to subscribe because I found it way easier to take photos of what I'm eating when I'm out and filling the meal description when I get back home. What's a little bit of money if it goes a long way in maintaining good sugars and health eh?""Brilliant app. After 6 years on a pump I've gone back to injecting. This app has given me better control than the pump did. Pay for the reports and extras, worth every cent when it comes to seeing the Dr. If I was to ask for one thing more, a built in calculator next to the carb input to save jumping from app to calc back to app. But that's a first world problem. Good job!""Helps me keep track of what I am doing right and things when they go bad.  Can look back on past results and improve""Gathers a significant amount of data into one location for easy viewing and tracking.  My doctor loves having it all in one spot and actually available.""It's easy and helpful  1) it shows correct information 2) it's a great app At all in short I love it""Worth pro. Helping get my health back on track one stabbity at a time.""Great app. Nice to see your results on a graph. Nice layout for entering data""Customer Service was a great help in setting up wireless data transfer. Thank you to Customer Angel Sarah K.""Great app for keeping track of Diabetic information. Pro reports are clean and informative. Android app is slow compared to iOS. Customer service is fantastic if you have any questions or concerns. Highly recommended!""Super easy to use. Keeps all data nicely organized. Our 8year old masters it from first entry!""This app makes you want to imput your data, where before I hated having to log and half the time i skipped it. you monster is super cool and you want to check on him. I love how easy the app is to use as well as the amazing customer service the tech guys provide. New Update 1/31/2018: I decided to try out the subscription service that allows for unlimited test strips for a flat fee of 39.99 a month and I am more than happy with it. You can not beat that price for the piece of mind it provides when you can test as much as you need to without the fear of running out. Thank you for taking the stress out of testing and logging, you guys rock!!""MySugr has been a great tool for me in getting my bg readings under control. I have been using it for a year and a half and have brought my A1C down from a 9.1 to 6.6-7.1 over the past year. The program continues to improve and I use it with an Accu-Chek Guide meter which syncs through Bluetooth with the app.  It is easy to use and log carbs and insulin. Being able to see estimated A1C is  good encouragement to log extra times. I backed off 1/4 with my testing and my A1C went up at my Dr visit. I am now testing more often and will be back to normal or better due to this program. They do have support and have also helped me with any problems I've ever had. I recommend MySugr highly!""You can log all the information you would ever need. The best diabetes tracker I've ever used, I've been using for years now and it's as good as ever \ud83d\ude01 highly recommend!""Great app! Easy to use and records lots of useful information. Also a great motivator.  Love the challenges!""Only option was American reading not Canadian uninstalled and could not transfer data""UPDATE: My doctor has added weekly Trulicity injections. There is no choice of common medications in which to enter this data except \"pills.\" There is no list of \"pills\" and I think there used to be. In any event it should be in a list of medications. Thank You.   Got Aviva Connect meter, and I actually like taking blood! It's fun watching it magically appear in the app.  \ud83d\ude00 Even adults will feel happier logging with this app. Motivation is built in. I actually enjoy using the app, and that's a big part of diabetes self-care. I don't want diabetes, but you make it as much fun as possible. Thanks! One thing that would make it even better would be picking up My Fitness Pal carb data. That would make your app into a complete and effortless diabetes hub. I read the explanation on the web site, and it seems you are depending on Google Fit for all health data. Why not import My Fitness Pal's carb readings directly at, say, 11 PM every night. So many hub-apps have integrated My Fitness Pal into their apps. I'm sure they'd be pleased to allow access, since they do so with so many other apps. All you need are the carbs in grams. (Yes, I know it's lazy not to just log it, but diabetes self-care  is tiring, and this seems like a simple thing to add.) That said, thanks for the fix on the step counter and the lagginess. Works accurately and is absolutely snappy now!!! Thank you for this wonderful app!!!""I gave up on this app. I was using the Accu-Chek Aviva Connect, but I kept having to do the pairing over and over again. I picked up the Contour Next One and have never had to pair it again. Mysugr is a pretty good app, but they currently have no plans to support the Contour Next One. If they ever do change their mind, I might come back.""I had been a loyal and happy user of Glucose Buddy for many years. It had just a few annoying user interface issues (too many \"clicks\" to accomplish the task) but the feature set was fantastic. Black Friday I got a new device and found I couldn't migrate my data. And just before Christmas the app was sold to a new company that gutted the product. Forced to find a new app I checked out mySugr. WOW!!! More and better features than Glucose Buddy AND a cleaner, richer, more intuitive user interface. This app is perfect!""Very Easy to use. Great way to keep and print data for my doctor.""If you want to export or send any data, you have to pay for the pro version, pretty worthless if you want your doctor to look at any of your data.""The reports generate a fair bit of paper. Informative, yes.""This would be a good app but I can barely use my phone because of all the ads that come with this app! I'd rather pay a few dollars than put up with the flood of ads.""A great way to manage my blood sugar without feeling overwhelmed by the information it provides.""This application is great. I can log my information and show my doctor at appointments. It keeps me accountable.""This app has been such an amazing tool for our family. It makes keeping up with my son's info so much easier that what we were doing before. And, since we can use it on different phones and tablets everyone who helps take care of him has the same information at their fingertips so there's no more forgetting to share info with his other caregivers. I LOVE this app and very highly recommend it to all!""I am having to re-pair the meter multiple times daily, to get it to transfer data to my phone.  I am using the Accu-Chek Guide and the HTC 10.""Too many updates!! Keeps jumping from external to internal memory. It's only a BG log so why update so often? Huge memory requirement. Basic function is excellent but is bloated in memory usage.""I am a HORRIBLE type 1 diabetic. I should say,  WAS... a horrible diabetic.  There would be times that I went weeks without testing my blood sugar. Ever since I discovered this app,  I have found myself testing my sugar more frequently to 'tame the monster.'  It's very easy to use,  a really great user interface,  and offers encouragement even if my sugars aren't that great... which is why I would typically stop testing in the first place.    Thank you mySugr for getting me back on track.""I like the free features but I think the reports should also be free since it is my data I am entering.  Otherwise great app""Easy to use and track data""I don't like to give email for this sort of thing.""Helps me keep track of my sugars. I'm very busy with school and activities and I kept losing my log book. So I downloaded this app and since then I haven't missed a log. But it's a bit confusing at first.""I'm very impressed with this app. It is very comprehensive and useful at the Free level but I opted for the Pro account for the additional features. In particular, I like being able to take photos of my meals. It gives me an opportunity to see the quantity of the food I'm eating at a glance.  FOLLOW UP: The Accu-Chek Guide being offered as a bundle for mySugr refuses to remain paired with my Samsung Galaxy Note 5. I can force it to pair by unpairing and then pairing it again, but it will complete a single data transfer and fail an hour or two later for my next test. Don't bother going for the $39.99 bundle. It just doesn't work reliably at this time - at least not for me. Knocking off a star for the disappointment and expense I incurred to change my meter. Not worth it.""My consultant thinks this app is amazing. He loves that I can just easily email my results. I love it too - it's just so much easier than writing everything down. Easy to see patterns and to adjust insulin. Easier to control diabetes. I thoroughly recommend.""So useful! This app has positively affected my diabetic regiment. Fun and informative! I recommend this app!""Easy to use and fun. Makes tracking sugars something I want to do rather than a chore. Good information about diet,exercise, and support, if you need it. Just about perfect!""DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!  Not Good! Set up was kind of difficult and they want my email address so they can SPAM me! It's not user intuitive and when I finally figured out how to enter my blood sugar level, it made an stupid audible LOLOLOL! Sound. Why is it making fun of me? I don't consider my medical issue something to laugh at!""Works great and easy to use. But needs \"reports\" functions to be formatted better. I have to spend a lot of time reformatting the data, before I can give it to my doctor.""I really like the convenience of the AccuChek automatically uploading my data. If I am true to my diet log I can see the results of what I eat on my glucose levels. I would really like to to see the ability to save meals and pics to drop in my logbook. I definitely recommend this combo of app and glucose monitor.""This is so easy to use and track the information I want to track. I used the free version for a month and liked it enough to upgrad to the pro version.""I really like this ap. It gives me some accountability for my blood sugar. .it makes me aware of how what I'm eating causes spikes.  I can set reminders to check it whenever I need to do a follow up.check.  It gives an estimated A1c level based on readings I've logged.  I showed it to my Dr. and he thought it was very cool too!""Love this app but wish there was a way to transfer information. Got a new phone and have to start all over""Told me to enter code to make Bluetooth connection but no field to enter""Super easy to use, informative and really helpful. Not to mention fun icons! Great value too.""I love this app, it had made my tracking blood sugar levels so easy. And the information is all right there for the Drs to look at.""As soon as you start it it wants to set up an account.  I don't want an account, I just want to play with it for awhile before deciding if I want to use it or not.  Where's the skip button?  Goodbye!""

Joke of an app""Can't sign in. Receive a message of 'unable to fetch data from the server.'""It referred me back to the company.

They tricked the DOD into approving a contract that says that they will not accept any other types of payment.  Not a  check. EFT, direct deposit or even Money orders ONLY PULL BANKING which means they reach into your account and pull out whatever they want whenever they want. But they promise to only take what you owe for coverage.  That's not what has happened to many Veterans and the State House Reps say they can't do anything until the contract is up for renewal.  Keep this info circulating in the public so that they will be forced to change this with the new contract.""Locked me out after 2 attempts to login using the correct username and password.""Can't login.

I just found out that Delta Dental uses your Social Security Number as your subscriber ID (I was wondering why I couldn't find my subscriber ID online...); And this app allows you to email your \"ID Card\" to your dentist which, for subscribers who have their SSN as their subscriber ID, this emails your SSN in plain text to your dentist's inbox.""This app is so slow I feel like I'm using an landline lol save your self the time just use the web I will come back when you guys do some up dates & why do I have to log in every time you guys made an app that can't remember my log in come on""I have a Northeast Delta Dental plan, but the app says it can't find the account even though the online account is clearly active.""Just got the app, so far it is working great! I could email myself a card.""Worked just fine for me, very fast and easy way to get my ID card without carrying one in my wallet.""App doesn't allow log in. Email address provided for support does not reply. Unfortunate I looked forward to using.""Looks like the developer wrote while he was at sleep. Useless app... Nothing works. The reason for the world going to App based model is to connect from anywhere from any devices and obviously your company also did that but that purpose got defeated by the guy who designed it and how your product management approved this app to be released for general availability with out any proper QA. Go back to your drawing board and rethink your ideas for this app. Customer doesn't need to call your support unless and until it's required, but in one single login your app lost it's hope.""Says email address is incorrect....with both email accounts. Worthless!""Went through the establish an account - filled everything in correctly, Submitted but rejected because \"email didn't match.\" Match what? It was only entered once. No contact us or help either.""The worst experience I have ever had with both the mobile app and customer service. If you can avoid doing business with this company, stay away. The app is horrible, and customer service much worse.""I like how you can email your id card!!! So far so good""I'm not able to register. I keep receiving different error messages on page 2 of 2 when registering for my account.""Privacy regulations don't allow display of claims or coverage? So unless you need to view a card or use a timer to brush your teeth.... Uninstalling""1. Option to remember login/password 2. Option to store ID card even without logging in 3. Option to add access to dependents. They are in the wild without insurance card of their own""Can't log in! Keeps saying info is wrong!  Now I'm locked out of my account.""I sign in easily online. ...the app keeps saying I have invalid information which is false. :-( So I uninstalled it.""I can't log in, which seems to be a common issue with this app. It's smart enough to know I already have an account when I attempt to register, but it's not smart enough to let me use it. Oh well.""Unable to access my account because there are account validation issues? Customer service was completely clueless as well.""If you are attempting to use your website login info and it's not working, it's because you have to register with the app itself and create another login/password for the app itself. Dual accounts. You can use the same login/password for the app that you used for the website. That should work. Good luck! :)""Clicking on \"My Coverage & Claims\" i get the error \"Unable to fetch data from server\".  This is the most important feature and it is NOT WORKING..!!!""This app is useless and it sucks.  Can't create an account with the info I am supposed to use. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!""Tells me my user name and password are but correct, but I have no issues logging in via my pc.""I can log in fine on the full site... but can't log in on the mobile app. This  app used to work fine. Please fix.""This app is worthless!!!! I just downloaded it and it will not let me log on. It says that either my username or password was entered incorrectly but I can log on just fine in my web browser. Fix it!""I tried for ten minutes to log in. Then once I got in I was thrown to a page telling me my data didn't match the data base. I now just use my lap top. It works fine there. No errors""None of my information loads. The only thing that works is the link the website.""Love the speed and accuracy of this site, plus I can get a copy of my id card any time I need it!!!""Update 31 Jan 2014: Login problem had been fixed but has now reappeared. Bother!  App will not let me login to my Delta Dental off CA account. Displays a validation error message and bounces me into the browser, where I can login. App is a complete waste of time.""Thanks for fixing the bugs. It's so convenient having my card in my phone.""After a few emails they got my account updated and it works now.""Email ID cards returns server error, searching for local dentists is slow and does not allow selection of dentist from list.""I can login and review just about everything but when I select My Coverage / Details it shows the following error message : Error Code 605 - Unexpected error. Once I hit ok the app closes.""Now that I can finally log in the app works great. Only complaint is that the ID card doesn't have subscriber info...only my name and the address/phone for the DD of my state. After emailing support my issue was  resolved but I never received a response.  I stumbled upon a response to my review here that asked if my issue was resolved.""Not able to login to my delta dental Mi ...says username and password invalid""this app doesn't do anything but just find a dentis near you . Is july 26 and still . No card iD . No claim check . App still horrible how long we going to have to wait ?????""If all you need is to find a network dentist, then this app should fulfill what you need.  That being said, it is pretty poorly constructed.  Graphics are flimsy, buttons are small, the \"find a dentist\" feature simply directs you to their website.  There are really no native features to this \"app\".  You will have better luck with their mobile website.""App does basically nothing. It takes you to one single webpage which works better if you just use an internet browser. I really wish this app would include a digital ID card for my proof of insurance.""    ""com.optum.rx"":     ""Thorough, informative information on drugs...fast, efficient ordering and delivery...great app and service, too""Had to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work.  I had to reset the password as well.""I've been trying to log in for 3 weeks. The app obviously has some technical difficulties. I get routed back to the same sign in, over and over. Very frustrating. Also, can't open app from my UHC medical app. What's going on? Rediculous! UPDATE: y'all send same response to everybody. Site is.horrible. please fix BUGS for login!""At first I could access my information. Now I can't get past the start screen. Will not let me sign in.""The pharmacy search disregards zip code inputs- doesn't work.""1st I cant access the prescriptions my Dr sent in directly, it only eants to pull in my old scripts from doctors I no longer have.  2nd customer service cant seem to find my account when I call in for help.  It seemes easier to just pay for my medication then try to navigate this program.""A ridiculous amount of security measures for an app on my phone.""Overall its a good app but there are a few flaws that are very frustrating. I don't know why I have to put my username and password in every time. There should be an option to save my username. It doesn't have a fingerprint login option either so its more passwords to remember. The screen is not user friendly when adding personal info like address and credit cats info either.""Terrible app. Not user friendly.  Doesn't give co payment amount. In some cases doesn't show number of pills.  User service terrible,  too. I am surprised they stay in business""Why won't it offer to save login info so u don't have to take time to look up login info in order to access ur account????  Other than that, it's ok.  Not as easy to use as u would think.  I would think an older person who is a computer novice with access would have a difficult time.  BTW, I'm 70, but yrs. of experience.""As a new \"member\" through our health insurance, we are told we MUST use either the OptumRx website or app for our prescriptions. We set up our account online and downloaded the app. Now we can't get back onto the website and the app will not open. There should be a zero star option as this process has been extremely agrevating and has raised my bp which now I can't even get my prescription refilled for!!!  Very, very unhappy user!!!""Can not have my husband on the same account as mine. Tried to set up separate account. It won't do it? Need to setup an account for my husband.. Please....""How could I recommend when I do not have a member card. How do I get a cards. This app is  of no help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""Gave a 3 because I do ship & bill and the app won't allow it.  Also because I can't she my daughter's stuff also due to sign in everytime and sooo the phone verification.  How's about using a number code???""Why can't the app remember me? I have to login each time. Doesn't even give the option to remember my user id. I understand that security is important but have an option to remember the id. Logging in with a keyboard that doesn't have numbers and switching between keyboards to enter the complicated \"healthid\" UHC requires is frustrating.""It does let you see what meds are there but it doesn't really tell you anything under the prior authorizations. And it doesn't say how long it's supposed to take. I ended up having to actually call to get additional info. It's very limited information.""It's easy to see history and to see what is going on with account. It also keeps track (in the history section) of all your prescriptions and what they cost, plan paid and what you paid. I like this application.""It will lock your account and make you sit on the phone for hours while they unlock it.  It is full of bugs but the one time it did work it was okay.""It's confusing and offers contradictory information depending on how you look things up""Great I can manage my account anywhere from my phone.""I had troubles ordering today, having to input credit card info when there is no charges.""Getting into thoughsecurity was horrible. First it said my password was wrong. Try again. Password was wrong again.tried again. Shut me out. Started out by asking if I wanted to reset password. Reset password but system said I couldn't use my last password ( same password they said wasn't my previous password). When I finally got through the password they sent my a code by text. I couldn't get to my text w/o getting out of app. After 3 codes I figured out how to get text w/o escaping app. Tell me if this is frustrating? You bet it Is! I should have called. Much easier!""It's better than their website, but that isn't saying much. Both are terrible. Hard to use, slow to load and can't do anything on it.""Would not let me order medicine despite being very patient and trying multiple times. I would input all the information needed and I would get the Please wait screen I waited 10 minutes and nothing. Even logged out and tried a few more times, no go. Reinstalled the app and all of sudden my username and password is not valid! It was the exact same information! Also, it had missing family members.""Only 1 thing wrong with this app,  I can't access as a caregiver from my account.""Since they got the app working it is been but pretty good app but it still needs more work I wish there was a way that when you need a new prescription from your doctor you can hit or send a message to the app no thanks to the farm is in the knee early so they can get a new prescription or call the Dr and get it ahead of time cuz sometimes doctors get so busy that they don't have time with all the patients that they have so it would be nice that let's say when you're out of a prescription and you need one from your doctor that a couple weeks of head of time before it is supposed to be filled you can go ahead and hit a button or send a message and let them know so they can go ahead and get a hold of the doctor can't get a new prescription but pretty much an all right out since it's been working it took me almost a year or half a year or two get the app to work but since it's been working as great""Much easier to navigate, would like to have image of my card available""I literally just installed it, it kept taking me back to the damn register page. I already have a log in. So I kept hitting sing in, kept telling me authentication error. Mind you, I just literally installed it and as soon as I did it said it needed to update, seriously??? POS app, never got to sign in on it. BS APP!!!""Tried to sign in... tells me to register.  Re-register and app tells me I already have an account and to just sign in.  Try to sign in... and tells me to register account.  Stuck in a stupid loop like a bad Groundhogs Day!    Do these awful reviews mean anything to the app developers?""This is the worst app!!!!!!why don't you put something people can use. Will not accept username password or member Id. Useless""This app use to work fine. Now when I  try 2 use it it ask for a txt or phone call be made 2 get an access code. NEITHER WORKS. I end up calling the company anyway 2 order my meds. Fix the problem & I will consider giving u a better rating & stop telling my friends how much I hate this app!!!!!!!""Slow to load""Website slow when it does work. Will not show pricing on meds requiring renewel from Dr till you are billed and shipped. Unfair practice?""The worst.  So slow. Optum is the worst. The website is just as bad""This app is the biggest piece of trash. It has completely ruined my entire account now. Can't even use the webpage now. Don't install it or use it!!! Customer service is not able to help and I can only call in orders now. Time to use local pharmacies again!!""Doesn't work. Will not recognize email, yet it sent me email. Can't get username or password. Can't check status of orders. Totally worthless. Everyone with a complaint gets the same camned response rather than spend time to fix. The biggest problem is their website and phone service is worse than the app. If I could ever get my last round of prescriptions, I'd never use them again.""It's slow. Slow to login, and so incredibly slow to order is useless. Guess I'm still going to have to use the website or call them. So much for being convenient.""Never lets me log in. Multiple attempts, resetting password etc. As useless as the website.""Can't access account from app on Android and IOS  no problem on internet""Terrible app. Missing prescriptions and order data. Signon function does not work consistently. Hire some good app developers.""Stops working, incredibly slow, erroneous or missing Rx...and, I do to get notifications I have signed up to receive.""Hard to use. Extremely slow. Verification system lacking user input""Cumbersome.  Every little thing takes several steps and when you finally input information in the exact manner the app needs it the app freezes and you get no results.""My health plan transferred to OptumRx from Express Scripts. This app & the OptumRx site, in general, are painful to use on a mobile device compared to Express Scripts""Got registered fine. Tried to log in, and all I got was a single string of code. No user interface, no info. Android 7.0 on Samsung Galaxy S7, Sprint.""Does not work on my Android tablet : does not find closest in-network pharmacy; includes RX over 2 yrs old/expired; can't enter data for location!""Worst app ever. I'll be going back to Humana next year. It said there was an error in login in, but I just continued and it let me in.  It said there was an error in placing my order but I went to order status and it said the order was being processed. Who knows if it is or isn't. I bet OptimumRx gets more orders placed over the phone then through the app.  Seems could divert some staff salary time for phone orders to app development.  Its not like y'all just opened the pharmacy. Come on folks.""This app sucks and is very buggy. Does not let you add a debit Visa card as a payment type and does not give you an error to tell you so. Made me reset my password.....again. If this is the \"new and improved\" interface, you need to seriously QA your app before throwing it out there to your customers.""Very difficult takes 2-3 attempts to sign in, keeps saying doesn't recognize my user info &/or password. And it went allow use of AOL.""Overall it works well.  The main screen shows all pertinent information.  I had some issues with the account settings not showing the id card/other information.  It will also not take or show updates I made.  It would be nice to store more than one credit card on file.""The app is horrible! You pull a medicine to check coverage and pricing and it pulls a completely different med. If you don't waste battery with your GPS on it asks you repeatedly for a zip code, even after you set your pharmacy. The old app was incredible. Who ever created this app obviously hasn't tried to use it. Please fix this app. Some of us rely on this for our health! The more I use this almost useless app the worse it gets. I am so frustrated with this app I literally want to punch someone in the head. The previous app was bad. This is deplorable. I am not even sure there are words that accurately describe how bad this app truly is. Your developers failed, yet again!""This is absolutely the buggiest app I have ever used. I can't even sign in, it says user not active! It's force-closed on me 4 times already just trying to get to the point where it won't let me sign in! For the love of God, hire a professional to do your app! This is absolutely garbage!    Update: Latest version is running better, but now I can't access anyone else in my family on my account. It literally shows only me, with no option to see anyone else. I'm set to manage my entire family, and this app doesn't do that. It is still worthless. Please fix it.""How in the Hell do you change your credit card.""Will not work as an app on my tablet that doesn't have a phone . In order to check my account I have to use the internet""Won't let me sign in with my optumrx password!!! Why do I need 2passwords to order my medicine???""App doesn't work on my phone, so not fully mobile. New contract on pharmacy, so forced to use, and seems to take extra interaction with customer service to have the account ready to use. Customer service reps try to be helpful.""Very unstable and will not start part of the time. Very slow, but as bad as it is, it's better than the Web site which really sucks!""This app is useless. Most of the time it won't load, when it does, I try to enter information and it says unavailable, try later. With all the app writers out there, someone must be able to do better than this!""Extremely buggy!  I give up!  Going good back online.  Not that online version is all that better.  My company FORCES us to use them.  Tons of customer service issues.  I don't really think they care about the consumer.""So slow that I use the computer to look things up.""Sometimes I forget to reorder my meds because there are many things to remember to do when I get back to my computer at home. The OptumRX app makes it easy and secure for me to order, check the status, and communicate immediately. It's the most up-to-date way to assure timely delivery of my meds.""Logged in to a blank screen. Tried going to my profile and got code on the screen""Doesn't map user info from the website. Then, once you re-enter all of your information, nothing loads except for the word \"prescriptions.\"""Mobile app wont load.  You should be ashamed for releasing a piece of junk (kept it clean) like this.  POS!!!""Wont link account""More often than not app doesn't connect. It doesn't matter if I'm on WiFi or cellular network. It's just a properly coded app.""App doesn't work properly. It remains stuck on prescription screen after login. Use the website on your computer or mobile for a better experience.""EMAILS""I've attempted to use this new app multiple times via andriod phone and tablet without success.

Click on refill and 30mins later you may get your order processed. I can drive to the pharmacy and back in the time it takes to request a refill. Terrible, terrible app.""Very problematic set up, the most difficult I've encountered. Repeatedly asks same questions. Even denies answers to \"secret questions\" for identification purposes as \"inappropriate.\" It's a junk app. I uninstalled it.""This app never works! Tried to refill my prescriptions using it and I get caught in an endless loading cycle every time. The mobile website isn't any better, finally had to go to the full website to complete my order. Someone should be fired for allowing this piece of junk app to be offered to the public. Epic fail.""the profile information is all in code. can't see any of the stuff that I need to do or have done. please fix... also the home page is empty, if it isn't there's something seriously wrong. please fix. like to see an actual working app.""This app is not working when I try to place order for refill using an Android tablet. The clock spins for a few minutes and comes back with an error message-\"An error was encountered please try later\". This has happened twice back to back with this Android tablet. My experience with this app on iPhone hasn't been good either; similar problems were encountered multiple time and I placed my order using either a phone or a computer.""Not sure what the negative reviews are for.  The app linked to my website profile, I clicked refill from the dashboard,  clicked my meds, verified info and credit card and submitted.  Done quietly from my bathroom with my wife sleeping!  I will use this every time.  Samsung S5.  UPDATE 10/16/16 - mobile app is broken and won't allow me to refill -it hangs endlessly.   I'm now using Samsung S7 Edge.  Thanks for doing the proper testing b4 releasing this version!""I have not been able to order my meds on the mobile app ever. I have deleted and readded the app and still no luck..""This is the worst app I have ever installed.  If you paid someone to develop this app, then get your money back!!

Kept getting error message, try again later. Took way too long to submit a refill.""Does not give information constantly says an error has occured""Email verification always fails due to invalid confirmation value""All information right there""Very slow and doesn't let me order my Rx and goes down.""The mobile app along with the mobile version doesn't work.  No matter what time or when trying to use it, I always received - \"An error has occurred. Please try again later.\"  I have given up trying to use Optumrx on any mobile device.  It is pointless.""The app is the most useless trash I have ever wasted time downloading and registering for an account I should have read the reviews and not wasted my energy... should be discontinued!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""Slow as heck, and doesnt really function well. Doesn't always confirm an order when in fact the order shows confirmed on a computer (full site)""My email and password has numbers in it.   Can't log on because I can't type numbers""I am utterly shocked! When I earlier created my account via a PC there was a requirement to include a number within my password.

I got an email from them and it will let me log in that way  but not from here.""This app will not allow me to use any number on my keyboard to log in. I have a number in my username but cant enter it. I can copy my username and password then paste to login but thats a pain to go through. I sent an email to the one provided at the bottom of app page on google play store and I received a response saying the email address is closed. So no way to report or try to fix this broken app.""It's a piece of garbage I have reset my password almost every time I need to reorder""Forget it if you use anything other than the letters of the alphabet in your username or password! The app doesn't recognize them. Useless!""App is slow and features dont work like theyre meant to. Usually have to log in via an internet browser so whats the point of having the app?

This makes it so I don't see information pertinent to my baby while she's in a particular stage. For example, the app just posted information on how my 13-month old may start pulling herself up in her crib and sleep regression often starts because of it. Totally useless to me as I went through this with my daughter when she was 6 months old. Half a year late to help me.""Gave me so much information when I was pregnant.

Please either add articles for older children or create one to help all parents equally  from birth to 18 . Thank you""I used the pregnancy app and loved it! Thought I'd give this a try, I love this too. It informs me on what to look for with milestones, and gives great advice. I find this app very useful.""We don't have much help from older generation.

If I had to rely solely on this POS of an app, I'd go back to sending messages to my dr through the receptionist.

It takes into account the Postdrome which has such a huge effect on my quality of life.  There are so many thoughtful features.  I really appreciate the careful consideration that goes into the design of the app.  Like the ability to add specific symptoms and triggers.  It makes the record far more useful.

It has helped us not only better inform our doctors but also has made it possible for us to track and better understand our migraines.  Thank you so much!""Wow this app is great and so easy to use. I used to track my migraines on my calendar but this is so much better and the reports are so informative. I'm learning what could be triggering my migraines after only 4 attacks recorded. Really worth the download I can't believe it's free.""I have chronic almost daily migraines. This app is amazing. It helps me collect data for my doctor so I can keep track of my headache days and what meds are working. It is helping me figure out my triggers. Pay the extra few dollars for the additional reports. They are super helpful. And the recent upgrades are awesome. Customer service is great. I highly recommend this to anyone suffering the way I am. Just having trouble finding the support groups. They seem to have disappeared.""This is a very helpful and intuitive app. It is very thorough and thoughtful, the designers seem to take into account real problems that migraine sufferers experience and I have work this into the design.""Very good assessment tool, just getting started so am curious to see what the trending data will show.""Great app! It has really helped me track my migraines and sleep. I have told my friends, doctors and pharmacists about it.  I added some symptoms and reliefs I use and found it helpful to see how many other people added the same thing.  The encouraging quote \"You are not alone\" helps me. I emailed the developer with a question and received a helpful response within 24 hrs.""This app helps me in so many ways. I love being able to record my attacks and the app provides kind words along the way. It tells you that \"you are not alone!\"""I like this app. Really like that I can log an attack and come back to it later. The only issue I have is there is no metric for constant base levels so sometimes it's hard to properly log an attack compared to my base pain levels. Would be great to be able to log base wake up pain to contrast it with attacks.""This app is an excellent way to track your migraines, sleep habits and the medications you are taking for them. It also lets you connect with other people who are just like you and talk about what is going on right now to get help and answers when you need them. Reports can be emailed to your Doctor which is excellent. Great new updates that let you share files in chat and post your picture.""Great app, really helpful in aiding recording the key information relating to an episode for future use both personally or by GP.""Really needs to have a multi day tracker and the ability to track pain levels across those multiple day attacks. Otherwise great app.""Just started using it and having a bit of trouble adding past migraines. Current was easy and the options are very comprehensive. Been using thru multiple attacks; this app is incredible!""This is a beautiful tool. Customizable in many ways. Data you can export. I think this is going to really help get a handle on my cluster headaches / migraines.""This app helps you track every little thing, skip steps when you're experiencing an attack, export data for doctors, and connect with other migraineurs through their Facebook page. They're very receptive to feedback (like changing app colors or adding steps) and post updates on research and treatments. I would be in a frustrated fog without it. Seriously cannot recommend highly enough.""So appreciative for this app! Extremely well designed and informative. Will definitely help to reduce attacks. Thank you!""This app is heaven sent.

Greatful that it is offered for free without compromising quality.""Sometimes I forget to go back to it for times, but it's very helpful being able to record the pains, and lengthy periods of my migraines. Very well put together.""I don't usually review any apps, but have to say well done.  This app is great. I love it.  Chronic migraine sufferer for over 30 years, spent a fortune on gadgets, remedies and painkillers etc as we do with little success. I came across this app by chance when hunting Google for some other miracle cure and thought sceptically 'yeah, ok like it's going to tell me something I havent already tried', but having consistent evidence to show to consultants etc has given me access to new medications and treatments.   I don't know what it to without this now, it has became part of my daily routine because it's so simple to use.  Information you input and held on app is editable so much as you can add/take away information, symptoms, medication. The sleep tracker isn't out by much and amazes me, cause it must listen for me snoring or something \ud83d\ude01.  Anyway, from someone who doesn't review apps, I'm going to stop gushing now.    Thanks guys for this, you might not have cured or provided pain relief but you have helped in many other ways.""Brilliant app - so much easier than trying to scribble bits of information down whilst in pain.  I  only wish that I'd have known about this earlier .""I've only been using this app for a few weeks and I can already see a pattern with triggers. It's so helpful to keep all the information in one place.""Just started using the app. Love the detail involved in recording all the symptoms. Makes it easy to review my attacks and record them accurately for my neurologist. Great job guys a brilliant app and easy to use.""I've been using this app since Nov 2016 and it's really helped keep track of every aspect of migraine. I recommend it **** very minor glitch-  doesn't always pop up to edit/end attacks.""This app has been a true BLESSING! during migraines I can't write notes,  but I can turn my phone lighting down & just click buttons to record vital information.  BEST #MIGRAINE APP I'VE EVER USED! THANK YOU""Good app with the ability to record lots of data about the  attack. I think this will be really helpful to record all my headaches and migraines and be able to see properly any patterns  A couple of suggestions for development: - being able to datestamp pain scales. It doesn't remain the same across the attack   - put each medication episode in as a separate event. I am still trying to figure out the best treatment and this would really help  I would have paid for the app even though I didn't need the paid features, but found it was a monthly subscription and I'm not comfortable with that model.""Awesome features. Allows you to track most aspects of the migraine symptoms and any patterns that present themselves.  One enhancement to consider...with regards to med/supplement tracking: please consider adding a timestamp to each dosage you record along with the opportunities to evaluate it's effectiveness (on a per dosage basis).  For instance: if I take rescue meds at 2 PM, I'd like to record how effective the pain mgmt was. At 6 PM, when it wears off, I discover that the same headpain has returned (part of the same attack).  Now, imagine the 40 hour migraine. 2 pills every 4 hours means I would've had up to 20 pills. This skews the picture greatly, leading the doc to deciding that it's medication overuse. However, when he sees a written breakdown he knows that it's all good. No abuse.  If the app could list when the meds were taken and you could later record the effectiveness of each dose it would greatly help.  Thanks for developing this great tool.""I love this app! I've been trying to figure out the barometric pressure for years since I know it's the major contributer of my migraines. In addition, to the humidity. This is the informative app I use.""Using to track my migraine attacks and it's an easy tool to use.  Very helpful so far""This app is amazing! Easy to use, brilliant features and a great way to track symptoms. All for free to, I've not had to make any in App purchases, you can even make a note of up coming appointments, it tracks when you sleep and you can email records to yourself and doctors if needed. Utterly brilliant!""Very easy to navigate and customize to my needs. Has all of the items I wanted to track as well as some others I hadn't even thought of. As a frequent severe migraine sufferer I am actually excited about what this app can do to help me get  a hold of my migraines, identify my triggers, report back to my doctor, and find the best treatment. There is also the option to have my anonymous data go to research so that my suffering can actually mean something! I am so happy I found this app! After trying many others, it is by far the best migraine tracking app out there.""Because of this app I was able to figure out a huge trigger for me that was being overlooked.  I love that it takes all sorts of factors into account.  Such a great app!!!!  Thanks for helping me track my migraines !""Love all the information you can input, triggers, type of pain, onset. Would love a place for general notes.""Very intuitive, thoughtful, informative and organized. And most importantly, ACCESSIBLE! (free). Thank you for helping me take control of my migraines.""Very easy to use and captures a lot of helpful data!!!  Only thing I would change is when logging a headache not calling ALL a migraine.  Sometimes a headache can start as just a headache and progress to a migraine.  It would be great to somehow track that.""I don't know how to record days affected before migraine attack.""This ap is easy to use and is helping me to keep a track of my migraines. So much data being recorded (symptoms, triggers, meds taken etc) and i especially love the sleep pattern and weather records, both of which can affect my migraines. Fantastic!!""This app was/is so useful for those of us suffering. When taken to the ER I am in no condition to explain what is going on with me and have handed over my phone and let them read the reports. This last time the ER Doctor was thanking me as they were able to diagnose and address in a short amount of time and at the right level. So many times before they would want to treat me for a stroke and would not or could not understand that that is just the level it goes to with me. I recently lost all information on my phone. When I contacted the developer they let me know all my information is stored on site and I was able to recover the information so I can bring it to my neurologist next week. When I reached out they responded in a matter of hours. Anyone with migraines should be using this application""Edit: I didn't know what I was looking at within the app and di dnt give this a correct review. Not only does it track your migraines.  It also helps compile the data after a few migraines to help identify triggers which is extremely helpful. 5 stars. Love love love love""Really good at keeping track and reviewing information. No glitches experienced""I am finding myself recommending this app to everyone that suffers from constant migraine.  This is a very well thought out and well organized.  I love the wizard-type start to each instance that prevents my pain addled brain from skipping a data point.  Thank you so much for such a thorough tracking app.""Great way to keep track of my headaches, and keep my health regimen rigorous. Helps me to also gather exact data to report to my MD""Absolutely fantastic app! Lets you get to know more about yourself and that migraine of yours, especially if it occurs frequently. Must have!  To the developer: We entrust you with our information.I hope you keep your promise into keeping our privacy and information. Great app! Cheers!""Design is outdated...Requires user to make an account to post logs.""Its great for help recording my migrianes and anxiety attacks.""This is an extremely good app for documenting migraines. I wish there was one like it for pain tracking. It allows you to select options by buttons which is visually helpful when you can't process words during a migraine. The information is then processed into a PDF document you can share with doctors and who ever else needs it!! I am grateful for a extremely functioning app that is for free! Thank you!!""Very complete and helpful in order to record and report back to doctor. Thank you!""I really love how easy this app is to use. It makes entering data while having a migraine super fast. I would like to be able to more easily track day to day activities like food, water, and meds a little more easily. For example,  I love the med reminder function but I have not found a place to confirm if i took the meds. Being able to confirm and enter a time for each dose would be awesome. Being able to do something like this for meals and water would be cool too. Overall after one week of use, I am still really happy with this app! Thanks so much.""Brill app. I particularly like a the sleep recording part too. Attention to detail good and I have had no issues with it at all. I also have epilepsy and it helps me track information that may influence that too. Overall simple to use and would highly recommend.""Brilliant, Informative & Easy to Use!!""This app is incredibly intuitive and monitors so many more data points than I would have imagined from a migraine tracker. Very impressive and easy to use UI.""This app is wonderful to keep track of when you get a migraine, how it was triggered, what helped, etc. It really helps us provide the right information to our doctors!""This is great i never used a migraine diary before it was too much work. This app takes a lot of the work out of tracking. I am a peraon that constantly has a migraine to some degree so it would be nice to have a feature that could track a standard migraine daily and add flare ups for the major mograines. I still enjoy using it just for the major attacks and would love more food related triggers added. I learned that some symptoms i had are actual symptoms too. Thank you so much""While I appreciate this app, I feel like there is a long way to go. My doctor can't find any information on if this is hippa compliant, so I cannot legally export the information to him. Also, as you can edit it as many times as you want, I have yet to find a way to edit the medication to show how often I takebit. So if my migraine is a week long, it shows I took my med once the entire duration.""Makes it so easy to record migraines.  Just started using it but I'm finding it really helpful. Haven't tried reports yet, but the way it prompts timing,  medicines, and lets you come back to update seems great.""very comprehensive app for taking almost everything that can cause or worsen a migraine into account. a little buggy, though.""It takes a little while to fully comprehend how useful app is. You can be as detailed as you wish in the information you put in. As with most things, the more detail you put in, the better the results you get.""I suffer with severe chronic migraines. I have been getting them for 22 years now and I've tried to journal my attacks.. I would journal them for a week or so and then just stop because of the hassle of trying to remember all the details of eac h attack. This app takes away the hassle. I use it every time I get an attack. It's really simple to use and has so many details and I love the fact that I can print it out and take to my doctor. This app is a 100% must have for anyone suffering with migraines. I'm so thankful for this app.""    ""com.zlamanit.blood.pressure"":     ""This is a great app.  Easy to record and email results.  Can't say enough good stuff.""A great app for BP trending. My Doctor appreciates the data as much as I do.""One of the best BP, Pulse log. Easy to enter, easy to share.

Excellent way to keep track of BP measurements. It's great to be able to export the results and email or print them out for the doctor. Minimal ads and very unobtrusive. Well done on putting this out there.""Have had this app on prior blackberry, used it everyday faithfully for 3 years, email a excel spreadsheet to doctor he keeps it on file for reference. It is your own complete record of how you pay attention to yourself, letting you direct your own course.  Very easy to use, prior to and during workouts, we'll done""Love this app. Great, easy to use interface. Easy to add new data and view history. More importantly the ads are not that intrusive. You get one ad after a new entry. It's easy to close and then you're free to go about the rest of the app without more popping up.  Great way for me to track my progress and my doctor always appreciates me being able to show the full history.   I also like that I was never badgered to make this rating. I sought it out myself coz it deserves 5 stars.""Very simple to use, and efficient for data entry.  Charts are helpful for identifying trends.""It would be nice to have a login so I can se my data across all my devices. It is easy to log your data in the app & I like being able to add weight & oxygen, as well as misc factors like medications.""Easy to input data w/comment +weight, meds, foods & exercise. Data collected is read in different ways and can be emailed to your doctor.""No import from other App., I am currently using another App that can export to CSV file,it world be great if this App can import the data like your Blood Pressure App can.""Wish it could receive data wirelessly. Partner with a BP device etc... Or work with and help list any wireless devices it would be compatible with etc. ...""Fantastic App.  If I could make it better it would collect the information direct from my Omron HEM - FL31 because their App isn't a patch on this one""Help me to monitor my blood pressure after having two heart attacks and not being to get blood pressure down.""A fantastic app. Entering and saving data is simplistic, just like it should be. I just backed up and exported the data file also; again, could not have been easier. To the developer, thank you sir!""Great app!

Easy to send, print,view, email show doctor.""Best app I've had for blood pressure recording. I've just gone premium although the adds aren't to bad. Would recommend to any one who has to keep records of daily pressures, you can also email to others if required.""Simple, clean interface and easy to use.  Especially if you need to print or export your data.  I love it!""Email  option not working and not able to share data on whatsapp is also not working.""Its really easy to see how my blood pressure is measuring for the day. I started on blood pressure meds and it's a quick way to record the information, so I can share it with my doctor.""Like the simplicity of entering data, ability to add notes and statistic reports, everything I was looking for without being overdone.""Simple to use.  Include as much or as little information as you like.  Data transmissions are impressive as noted by my doctor's nurse.""Easy to use, emailing my logs to my dr was super easy. Made it way easy to keep track""Very easy to record and retrieve data""Amazing app and I love that it will email results for my doctor.""Easy to use and understand.  I just use the basic information but a lot of options if more required. Quick to fill in""Easy peasy, input the values and after awhile you will see a trend based on your history data.  Email or message it to your Dr.""Terrific way to record my blood pressure readings. So easy to use and the stats information is very helpful""Love it. Love the data presentation. I paid which got rid of the ads but I really paid as a 'tip of my hat' to the devs that made it. Nice work...nice work.""Quick data entry, as you fill in one field it automatically goes to the next field. Great for recording both my husband's and my BP.

Being able to track and correlate other data points has made planning and following a treatment plan very easy.""Extremely easy to use. Data output is awesome .""I highly recommend this app. Playing with it to find out just how much it can do is like puzzle, but worth it. My Doctor was also impressed when I sent him my data. The ads aren't bad, I went ad-less after seeing how well it was received by my Doctor and to support the developer.  Thanks.""easy format...love that I can email to Dr.""Easy to use. Trends are easy to follow. It's helpful to have an area to enter notes that are shown with the data (i.e. after exercise, after meds etc). Thank you!""This is the best app I've found for collating a full range of medical observations you might do at home. Including Blood pressure, Heart rate, Blood glucose and oxygen saturation. It also calculates Pulse pressure and Mean Arterial Pressure which can be important for spotting heart problems. It's got really impressive and comprehensive information analysis and management like separating readings by time of day etc but I'd like to see slightly easier/clearer graphic display of systolic and diastolic readings on the phone. Haven't tried the printouts yet. Maybe clearer. Thank you for this great app.""Just what I was looking for, something for important information, yet simple to use and you will have the info with you practically all the time.""Helps me to easily track and send my data to my medico.  Nice.""This is an excellent cardiovascular logging/analysis chart.  This app will give you easy setup, clear displays and analytic graphs/charts that can be based on all normal data headings, with some extra settings available.

I strongly recommend this app to anyone who has need of great data collection and analysis!""Great features and ability to email reports.""Easy to use.  Good information""This app is very good and simple. It's fit for purpose and a helpful tool to inform users. It's good for patients and doctor collaboration. May be further improved with health tips and health information links. Users always want more. Thanks.""Simple data entry is it's biggest selling point. I compare it to Samsung health with it's sliders and whatnot - bad user experience.  This you press 7 numbers and you are done.  Also like all the ways to view the data. It's utilitarian and I like it.""Just enough information without being overpowering. Very easy to enter data, with the ability to set up reminders. A very useful easy to use app. :-)""One place to input my reading and a history I can look back to review how I'm doing.

Instead of having to write it down in a book and keeping up with it all you do is put in your phone and then you can email it to  your doctor!!""And can email to Dr.""No way to show day of week in date field. I've only got five days worth of data in there but since it doesn't tell me day of week  like Friday or Tuesday  I'm finding it difficult to refer to the information to discuss with my doctor . I also don't find graphs / the way the data is displayed to be helpful...another sort of display if data would be better. And I would like a way to type in the time rather than to scroll through numbers. This would be especially helpful in entering historical information. There also needs to be a way to save from the entry screen with one keystroke.""Easy & lots of info: It asks the right questions & data entry is super easy to do. Has multiple graphs to see trends. You can email info to your doctor!""Great tool for tracking blood pressure with graphs emails etc""Quite excellent except for a couple of graphs which show indistinct or obscure data points.

Great job.""This app is great to track blood pressure daily as well as track blood glucose levels.  It also allows you to enter reminder notifications, run reports for your doctor, set up more than one profile to track more than one individual and email reports for for individual profiles. Extremely user friendly!!!  Very impressed!!!!""Easy to enter data and display graphs.""A very helpful app. My phone sd card crashed and the app was gone so had to reinstalled it. Was so happy to find my previous records even after reinstallation. Thank you and keep up the good work.""Very impressed with the ease of using this app. Also, being able to email my doctor results with graphs and all? AWESOME!""It's good and does everything it says well, but i will only upgrade to  paid version and give 5 stars when this app gets at minimum saving of data to Google drive or Dropbox, and ideally integrate to health apps like Google fit. Been waiting two years for this and still haven't seen it""Helped me record data required by doctor""This app is great to keep track of you B/P. The restore function is malfunctioning will not restore data.""This is a fantastic app! I wasn't sure at first but once you get into it the tags and notes ability really make it stand out. With the tag I can have all of my symptoms ready to be added to the current  readings taken. You can do this for not just blood pressure but also glucose,  weight gain or loss, and O2 saturation. The tag you can head areas for all of your symptoms or any other influences that you need. Comedy ability of the notes you can record exactly what you're doing or any other information pertinent to the readings that you have just taken. Thank you developer/s for an app that is truly helpful to those of us tracking a disease! There's not a lot out there right now for us to use and I really appreciate what you have done here. Thank you very much and keep up the great work!  Using on: Samsung S7 Active 7.0 & Galaxy Tab E-T377A 6.0.1""Love the program, it's great at showing your history. I sent myself an email with all data because my phone was being replaced. I lost my first 2 months of data because nothing came through to my email but a link to download the program. Very unhappy as this was very important to be able to show my doctor. No idea how to get it back. What a shame.""I have spent literally days trying different apps. This application is the best free app I've ever seen! Very few ads and a wonderful UI. The extra perks of e-mailing your data to you in a concise and accurate breakdown, preset tags, auto input, etc are very good reasons to give it a try. This app also can record your weight loss, blood sugar levels and O2 eliminating the need for three extra applications on your phone. This application can be transferred to the SD card. I never review any app with this much enthusiasm but the creators deserve it.""Super easy to use. I just emailed it to myself to give to the Dr. and he had my history right there in front of him. Space for notes helps keep a bp journal.""Simple to use and informative""Nice, gives relevant statistical information""Awesome...easy and logical data entry, tons of ways to display results, analytics, graphs, etc.  Cool little app.""Easy to use and works great to share data with Doctor.  Love option  to have multiple profiles.""So easy to use.  Keeps the information in one place.  When Dr asks how is your blood pressure, click the app,and hand him your phone.""Easy to use.  I love that you can email and print to take to doctor appts.  It is exactly what I needed.""My doctor loved that I could print out a spreadsheet of my data""Very easy  to use. It allows me to keep the data for me and my sweetie.""The best BP log in the market. Easy to record new entry and make a note on specific entry.

Really satisfy""Great detailed reports but email feature does not work...can't get info to doctor.""An excellent tool. Very easy to use and provides a variety of ways of looking at your results. Data and reports can be emailed, exported as a spreadsheet, or shared with other apps on your device. Very well designed and has a very friendly user interface.""It works great, print outs are helpful. I'm with the VA, their secure messaging service keeps saying file not in the proper format. If this could be fixed it would be a fantastic Application.""It's amazing app. All clear. Design simple. If you want to print info for your doctor it sends amazingly nice documents to your mail in different formats. It is simple and functional. That's what I need! Just woul like to have weight data to be not text but as a number and generate a graph :)""This has a well thought out design that makes it simple to use yet offers beautifully detailed exports of your data. In short, this is the best blood pressure monitoring app out there.""I really like having multiple ways to veiw the statistical data. Very easy to use and I think it helps motivate you to continue consistently tracking your BP status. Thanks!""Easy to use and provides a lot of information""Exactly what I needed. I was impressed by the fact that I could even email a spreadsheet to my doctor.""Perfect ap for me. Very easy to use yet provides my doctor with all the information he needs to monitor my condition. It even gently reminds me when it's time to do a test.""Amazing app & reports are so informative. I have printed them & taken to the Drs who were well impressed too, but unfortunately not with my results. App is brilliant!""Loce it. Just wished I can change my email settings after they are set.

Is it possible to enter plotable body temperature as a tag or category having units of C or F? If it presently is possible then please clarify this topic as a Help item.  This app does what it claims = 5/5. Plotting C or F would be \"more\", but a greatly appreciated more.  While I'm on this subject but not wanting to be ungratefuly greedy, I'll ask \"how many additional data points can be plotted in this way\"? This would then be beyond perfect.""So simple to use.

Too often it gets stuck on the \"authenticating\" page, and then sometimes, if it does get past that, it's just a blank page. So please fix this app! It's the only way I clock in and out of my two shifts!""Very handy to have.. It is pretty easy to use.. Wish there was a color code for days working and days off on the calendar.""Can't fix password""I don't like that I can't go back and review my shifts from previous weeks.  Your clock in and out times aren't recorded. On the other hand you are able to see your client info and it does allow you to make comments and sometimes record your mileage.   Yoyo""When I pick up my client from another place it does not pick up the location. Considering this is when I need to clock in when I have to pick her up. And it is slow to clock in.""Slows down my phone, and the app is very slow too. Can't use it to clock in.""It recently prompted me to update the app so i said ok.it then prompted me to delete other apps i use that i dont want to delete, from my phone to clear up memory for your app.i could not clock into my client's shift or update tasks or clock out. I eventuality was forced to delete other apps from my phone that i regularly use that i didnt want to delete in order to use the app! Now 3 days later it is prompting me once again to update, but im afraid to because i dont want to be forced to delete other apps off my phone. When i looked for a way to contact tech support at clearcare it referred me back to my employer, whom i contacted but they were not very helpful and didnt jave a solution other than to say i prob dont have enough memory on my ph and maybe i should just keep using the old version, so i called clearcare and they said they couldnt help me at all because they only provide tech support to the employers.  Very frustrating also to be at a vlients and app is running slow or not working. I do not recommend employers using this app.  It's a nice app when working but unfortunately a lot of times isnt working and this is how im supppsed to clock in and out so i can get paid.""The only issue I see is with the GPS, I can be in their driveway or at their front door and it will tell me I'm 700 feet away but it still let's me clock in so it hasn't really effected me too much.""Very informative and easy to get into""The response is too slow when it comes to marking tasks. It needs to keep you logged in until you want to log out.  Like someone else said a 4 digit pin would also be nice.""When i try to go back out of profile screen it only gives me the option to \"cancel' or 'exit program'. Then i have to log back into the program again. It does that on another screen in the app to but i cant remember what one. That could be improved.""This GPS/ locator is off and states that I am several meters away from the client's residence when I am standing in the home attempting to clock in. Also I am unable to review information from my previous and future shifts. On the other app I was able to review all of the information from previous shifts and look at the tasks, etc assigned to future shifts. Also there should be an option for the to save the password and user ID for future login.""I can't clock in. It's very slow and takes a long time to load. And I can be standing next to my client and the GPS says I'm out of range when I'm literally in their home standing next to them. I just keep going online to clearcare to clock in because it's faster and allows me to clock in to my clients.""It stopped letting me sign in now.  Even though i have an account it wont let me sign in with me password or email""To slow! Takes too long and that is time taken away from the client!!""Would be better if it had an option to add shifts to your cell phone or Google calendar. Would make for a smoother scheduling experience rather than toggling back and forth between app and calendar to plug in your work schedule.""I would prefer it stay logged in, instead of the app logging out when not in use. Maybe make it easier to login with a 4 digit pin for quicker access. Its ridiculous that it logs out every time and I have to retype the whole password. If its for privacy issues, than I think its pointless due to the fact that I am the only one that uses the phone. The app should make it easier than the website NOT harder.""I can't login says that creditials are invalid and I can't change password, so I can't use app""It is very Informative""\"Remember me\" doesn't work on login and I'm unable to change password.""I enjoy the layout, my company is just slow to getting information on it.  And sometimes it skips to days ahead when I log on. Overall you got the app down pat. Thank you""Can't change the password and can't clock in or out most times""I change my password but it keeps going back to the previous one.""Logs out way too soon and it's kinda a hassle to log back in since it doesn't work with Samsung pass""Why can't you go back to see certain dates that you worked ..I would like to see my times""WILL NOT SAVE PASSWORD, which in itself is almost enough to make me uninstall it. Not intuitive. Text does not all display correctly. Only shows shifts in a linear format. Needs a weekly and monthly CALENDAR DISPLAY format. Difficult to figure overnight shifts - particularly if you happen to select the \"wrong\" day, it can actually tell you you have NO SHIFTS, when you actually will be finishing an overnight shift. That is VERY BAD when you are looking at it to make other appointments not related to work schedule!  As for the developer's previous replies that saving the password is not HIPPA-compliant, that makes NO SENSE BECAUSE THE WEBSITE SAVES THE SAME PASSWORD! How can it be HIPPA-compliant on a website online and not HIPPA-compliant on an app online? Just a cover-up excuse for a bad app deficiency. (I'm a physician, and have access to other places with a password that is stored in the cloud. Also, ours is NOT A HEALTHCARE COMPANY AND IS NOT REQUIRED TO FOLLOW ANY HIPPA LAWS AT ALL. LOOK IT UP.) Will probably uninstall and just use the website, which is much better. Note 8. Android 7.1.1""You have to click more times to clock out on the app then on the website. It also doesn't remember your login information""With this app I wish it would save my password where I don't have to keep entering it every time I access it. Also wish it would display all of what you're texting when you comment on your task or the comment section. So far, not too bad, but I've only been using it for a week now.""Easy, informative, hold tight to Google maps. Love it""It won't remember my password,  and I  clocked in on the telephone but couldn't clock out on my cellphone,  I also don't like the layout.""is there any link to reset your password with this apps""Don't like that i can't add mileage or go back and see hrs completed""Great features! Would be great if you could link the app's calendar to email or a native calendar app for reminders and updates to the schedules! \ud83d\ude0a""This app is very helpful in knowing about your client and keeping you informed of any changes.""Too many steps, the previous app was more friendly. I keep having to type in my password each time I sign in, the previous app had saved my password.""This apt is easy to use and give you good information about your client.  It also gives you driving directions to your client's location. I love the clock in and out feature also this is such a great apt for caregivers.  I have one issue pressed the uber map now not able to change it to Google maps. Please help!""Won't let me in using my password and I can't reset the password.""So far I like the app, although wish that it would save my login AND password.""I can't even open it it won't accept any password for me. It doesn't even ask for a new one just enter one. Would think you have to create a password first and a profile""I don't wanna type my password every time I log on, that's pretty inconvient especially when trying to clock in and out. Also hate how it takes you to a separate page to put in comments. Like how much time do you think I have to play with this app? Also randomly closes when ever it feels like it.""For the most part the app works great. Glad to hear that you'll be able to see more of the month in the near future. I was reading some of the comments that some of the caregivers wrote and as far as the password it does remember it if you wait about 5 Seconds it'll come up password for your email address and then you can just click the button to log in""I wish it would save the password for quicker log in.""GPS is not correct. I am under investigation for clocking in at a \"different location\" other than my clients residence. It takes me three tries to login, because of an \"incorrect password\". This app is a pain and I literally just started using it yesterday.""There needs to be a remember me password installed. Please ! It would save time!""Constantly drained battery by tracking location and not sleeping in the background. No fingerprint login option or ability to save password. I'll stick to the mobile website for now.""great for what I need but wish the password was saved or you could use your fingerprint to login faster through the app""    ""com.philips.sleepmapper.root"":     ""Good useful data.""At first it was very helpful in assessing new equipment performance especially with comparing masks.

Being a technical person, its nice to see how I am doing by means other than how I feel.   But disappointing that their is no functionality in my system without Wi-Fi.  And I am disappointed that the review options will not allow the lowest rating first so I can see some of the problems others are having more easily.  Gives me the impression you are trying to hide something.  2/25/18 update:  in addition to above, I lowered the rating because you aren't improving the app.  As time goes on, basic data, though impressive at first, is almost useless.  Inaccurate AHI's, as also reported in other ratings, seem to be a plague. We can't show our endocrinologist the app since we are not in bluetooth range of the machine, the app won't load.  Our sleep doctor makes us bring the the machine to every visit because your website is so undependable that they frequently can't get data for a patient they are seeing at the moment  so they download the data themselves.  ARE YOU LISTENING???""Simple to use.  A great way to make me more accountable to myself.""Very  informative and easy to use""I want the app to tell me how much the device works during a sleep night that spans two days. It seems to use calendar days not sleep nights. Am I mis-reading the data reports? Device doesnt update notifications of need for data after loading data.  App is almost useless.""For the most part it works. Occasionally it seems to lose connection to servers and I risk losing a day or twos data despite it being available on the machine.""I like seeing my nightly sleep information...""The information on AHI is helpful, but would love for it to show hourly data like the Fitbit app does on sleep patterns so I could see WHEN I am having problems, rather than just how many I had all night. This would be much more helpful.""It is good, but the AHI is not accurate. I had the machine on for an hour while awake. The data claimed I had several obstructd d sleep apneas and several central sleep apneas as well as hyponeas. None of these actually occurred.""Useful information real time.""It is easy to use and gives me 80% of the information I want about my sleep.""Verified compliancy at my fingertips!  I love this app. Easy to register, informative instructional videos and accurate daily progress.""The app/cpap machine regularly fails to download the previous night's data. Sometimes three or four nights a week.""The app has improved a little lately, but I still want it to show exact times of apnoeas and large leaks, so that I can see if they coincide with times that I am restless and my sleep is disrupted.""I downgraded my rating because of the annoying fact that if the phone goes to sleep, the app goes blank while it checks to see if there is any new data before displaying the bars.  I would rather have a button to refresh the data if the app is already open. Otherwise, I like the app""Latest update requires a refresh every time I open the app. It's horrible! Go back to non-refresh mode""Nice app for keeping track of therapy.  Had trouble checking nightly data when the system needed updating, thought it was on my end.  Works great now.""Has not worked for the last two weeks.I am ready to send everything back to provider.""This app doesn't work.  It won't connect via Bluetooth and it's hit or miss if any data is uploaded to the app from the cpap machine.""It's easy to use. Helpful information at a glance.""It's easy to use and convenient.  It's a little slow to connect and I'd prefer if it kept the last download displayed, rather than reconnecting when I turn my display back on.""Gives very useful information""Very useful information right on the machine!""Nice  to  see the data before seeing the doctor.""Easy to use. Like the information it provides. A little glitchy.""It has not uploaded my data in days""Very easy to use & very informative""I love it it is easy to use. I've only have one problem some times it won't download all the data""This is \"THE\" way to track how I sleep. Ease of Use and having the techs informed is the way to go.""Easy to use and valuable information.""Provides very useful information about your therapy.""Works flawlessly... Able to see data immediately without having to go to website""Simple to use,  however I would like to see more data or information about the data it has collected.""I recently was issued the Philips CPAP machine by the VA and they have an SD card in it so they can monitor our progress. Luckily I read about the app so I can monitor my own progress without waiting for them. I've found myself really surprised at the data it's been giving me because it's been showing that my apnea is worse than I realized. It's really nice to be able to see how long I'm actually using the machine and how much my apnea is affecting me. It's nice that the app has educational information for users, but I wish it had more interactive features. It starts asking you questions about things such as your motivation for using the machine, then doesn't really do anything with what you answer. The motivational aspect leaves a lot to desire, but overall the app is very useful.""I check my results every day. What a pleasure to be able to to have accurate information in my hand... up to date and informative. Great app!""If I could get it to stop restarting my phone several time over before I can get actual data on my sleep, I'd keep it.""Very informative. Would like a gaping function""Trouble setting up account""Easy to use, lots of useful information. Helps me know my machine is working and I'm using it correctly.""It seems Philips doesn't read this user feedback because there is not a single comment from them in response to any of these comments. Is it worth leaving my feedback? So, just a few things with a sense of futility at the possibility the Philips takes even the slightest bit of notice from users. [makes me wonder if they even listen to the medical profession do they?]   - Make the data more sensible by allowing the day end/new day start time can be set? There are shift  workers and they're not immune to apnoea.  - Why can some of the settings not be set by the user? Some are not critical to most users from a medical viewpoint and can be helpful. What is the harm of most user setting the ramp up - standard or smart - for most users? Make these kind of settings available as standard but secured by an administrator (medical professional) where needed.   - Why is some of the recorded information about myself not available for me to see? The info is there for the medical staff see it. Overall it's good but why am I not trusted by Philips? I have some sharp knives at home so should be trusted to the extent of basic settings, or will Philips take them away too?""Extremely easy to use understand. Very informative""Handy information right on your phone. Like the reporting function, provides a good overview of your results""I really like having the apnea and hypopnea event information and frequency.""Gives me good information.""Very informative.""Simple to use, provides helpful information and education.""Fantastic app, especially for those that like tomreview data and assess how their sleep is doing. I would however love to see more analytics similar to what the clinic sees when the pull reports from the memory card.""Great app. Gives me all the data I need daily to manage my sleep quality. Thanks!""Needs to show more information.""Very easy to use easy to set up great tool for monitoring your usage on the go or if you don't have a card reader on your PC""Worked great before (although missed 4 days of days. I'm 100% compliant). I switched out my machine. Same make and model except this one has a modem instead of WiFi. No longer connects with Bluetooth. Can't get data or reminders. : (""User friendly and provides very useful data on your sleep patterns.  I am hoping to use this data improve my sleep habits.""I use this every day  and use to help my doctor more data would be a great thing""Accurate and easy to use.  Would like more detail in the data, but that's just because I'm a nerd.""I have had some problems keeping the data up to date.""The app/cpap machine download needs to have an option for people that work nights.  The cutoff for data is 12 PM.  That's our midnight---it cuts the data in half; making it not as accurate.  Program a switch to change cutoff from PM to AM for day workers and night workers!""Nice to not have to remove SD card to read. More details in report would be fun.""Great app. Very informative and easy to use.  I like being able to track my sleep.""Informative: helps me track my progress and gives reminders to do maintenance on my apap machine. Useful: affords me the ability to generate a report to submit to my pulmonary sleep specialist. And it's uncomplicated, non-time consuming and easy to use. I love it!""This is very informative but it I would like it to have a place to put notes on the day to save for your doctor. For example if you numbers were high you could put that the mask had a leak.""I track my usage in an excel spreadsheet and I use the app to get the data.""Pretty simple to use and give you easy to read data on how your sleeping.""It doesn't give you any useful info if you have a constant pressure set. There is no way to get rid of the \"alerts\". It doesn't show you the clock times for your wear. If you started wearing it one night around 2100 and had to turn it off say at 0030, then when you turn it back on that time goes towards the next day, not that night. Confusing and hard to tell how long you actually slept when looking back.""I'm a new user and so far find it great just a few little problems with fitting the mask so there isn't leaking otherwise easy to sleep in.""Its really useful for any CPAP user to know what is the machine reporting. However, every time you click on the android app, you have to wait for the blue tooth to cycle to 100%. But sometimes, I just want to see the data when I am not close by the machine. Yet there is no way for me to by pass the wait and go straight to the data screen. iOS is same, I think.""This app provides good, but very limited information.  It will report on  an extremely short list of masks.  It is easy to set up.""Love this app. It helps me to know what is happening with my sleep apnea. It has a lot if great videos with information on what to do and explains what it all means.""Very easy way to keep track of my apnea episodes on a daily basis, allowing me to have more informed discussions with my pulmonologist.""It's a great app but it only has basic information - I would like to be able to see a report that shows the air pressure as a graph all night - such as the one the consultant sees. That way I could tell whether the CPAP was working well, rather than worrying!  Other than the paucity of reports, it functions well although it has to be able to contact the server rather than keep local information. I'm afraid I don't use the goal setting function.""Simple and easy to use. Gives easy to understand information on effectiveness of the device.""Very informative.  Remi ds you when necessary.""Gives me the information that I need""Worked fine, but now not showing any data past Jan 3rd even though new data has downloaded to the app.""It didn't work for a while but now it's back to way it was\ud83d\udc4d""Info very basic. Displaying time of apnoea events would be nice to have. If app can't talk to server when data downloaded then info for that night is never displayed, this is very poor as both the app and the device still has the data.""Not enough information  I would like to be able to see all the information such as my pulseox, #of times awake, #x stop breathing...essentially this only gives you the length of time the device is on, it doesn't even show when you fall asleep...I get more information from my fit bit.  But I am giving it 3 stars because the the medical field is so far behind on patient centricity  I'm  surprised there's an app at all.""Very useful for tracking CPAP data Does an excellent job of allowing me to track my breathing while asleep. Great to be able to upload my data from my CPAP every day via Bluetooth.""Needs to provide hourly information, not just a total for the night. Would like to see events and pressure per hour.""Useful information for tracking my sleep""It is good, but it would help to have definitions and more specific information""Did not accurately record sleep information.  Didn't record info. on some nights that I used machine.  Very disappointed.  Might get me in trouble with both my doctor and my insurance company.""Love getting daily data of sleep apnea types and numbers.""Keeps me informed.""Good tool to help me keep track on how i am sleeping and to share the data with my pulmonary Dr""App kept erroring out. Got it going and 2 days later, no comm in 2018. This app is hosed and the mask I got isn't very good. I want my old machine back.""informative""    ""com.AnatomyLearning.Anatomy3DViewer3"":     ""Loved the app until it kept saying \"can't connect to server\" on both WiFi and cellular data. Please fix this issue.

Amazing on my Chromebook with notes running alongside.  1 month update: Absolutely essential for learning anatomy for kinesthetic/visual learners. Nothing, including my textbooks, has helped me visualize the body as much as this has. I still can't believe its free.""Very slow and not loading after very long time and not working offline, better if they could make simple but effective app.""The app won't work on my phone. I emailed the developers about the issue, no response yet. It works fine on my friend's phone, even though we both have the same phone model.""I thought this app was amazing when learning the upper forearm. This is great for all the bones, muscles, and nerves. It also shows a 3d representation so you get an idea of how they travel, the insertions, and origins. A problem is there isnt enough information provided on the pelvis region right now, otherwise a great app!""Informative, love to see pics from all sides.""Accurate information made easily accessible.""Brilliant! I'm not a doctor but to me this app is very informative, in-depth and detailed. Graphics and U.I. great!""Very informative. Thank you very much learning made easier""I enjoyed the app. Especially with the small quizzes and the formating of your app and of how the information is laid out. Maybe a link with suggested books relating to the app would be very helpful.""It is very informative app.It is very easy to remember the names of different parts when you actually see them.""Good program, but the recent update destroyed it enough to necessitate a negative review. All of a sudden, It's incredibly slow on both startup, and normal use. Plus, the new layout is terrible.

Now, you always have your current medication list handy...no piece of paper to keep up with...no having to update that paper list every dose putt med change.

No problems with its usage.""Excellent app for drug dictionary.

This one is perfect for my needs. I liked very much the option to inform me before few days about the period.""I think it is pretty good.  I'd give it a whole 5 stars if they added 2 more things:  Perhaps color coding of intensity of the cycle pains.  Perhaps 3 letter coding for eg \"H\" headache \"V\" vomiting and pitifully \"D\" for diarrhea  etc. which can be found as average symptoms before, during and after a cycle.

Just a green banner at top of clean, simple pages of information. Icon on phone desktop is subtle too. White daisy on green background with just the word Calendar underneath. Would be nice if it synced the backup automatically, but I just got into habit of backing up as soon as each period has started. One bit that's really useful is to be able to go into settings and increase or decrease my average cycle length as my periods settled down after I stopped medication that had halted my periods for many years. This is my first use of a period app, smartphones weren't invented when I last had my period. I'll not look for another app though. This has everything I need.

For the wish list ... an easier way to drill down to the location for various features...ie, sending a message to my doctor.""Helpful. Easy to access. Great for using while at different doc office to share info. A must if mayo will be regular part of health care. Going to add. Log in on computer forst to set up account. Then try logging in on app. Make sure to allow automatic updates... found these things fixed the login and retention info others found. Also cant pay from app only from website..""Unable to log in at this time, unable to log in at this time, unable log in at this time...over and over and over.  Keeps wanting me to reset my password. Can log in on website without issue.""Won't send email to Mayo email account for password help.""I love the idea, but so far all I can do is adjust my profile. Trying to do anything else like view my appointments, records, etc it just tries to load and says \"Unable to load data at this time. Please try again later.\" I've tried regularly for about a week with the same results.""The future of patient information""At first I was having trouble logging in and then viewing information.   Tech support was very helpful. It's great to have all my information,  schedule and  contacts in one app.""Great app and resource. Not many clinics have the ability to email their care teams via an app. Very nice.""Pros: This app makes communicating with Mayo doctors and staff, scheduling appointments, and reviewing test results extremely accessible.                         Cons: App will not retain login information and there is no way to disable the daily health info delivery.         Updated 3/25/2016 - Thanks for making the newsletter optional!""I have called and had things checked and I still cannot login. I am at once per 30 tries and the trouble shooter will not email me.""I used to be able to refill prescriptions from this app without having to call but lately it's just been not working, its jusy showing a blank screen. Being so busy I wish i had that option still.""Have been trying to log in..put in user name and password, it tells me the letters entered dont match picture...there is no picture....the it locks me out for 30 minutes.""I can't log in. When I go to the page to send you a email it says page does not exist. Says they will send a email if your email is found in the system and still waiting as I know I am in there.""Unable to see entire location information. Shows floor but runs out of room to display Desk info. And unable to switch to landscape view. Suggest: use abbreviations. Blg, Fl, 3rd etc.""I can't even log in anymore it just says, Unable to log in at this time, everytime I try. And I try to have it send me an email resetting my password and I've gotten no emails everytime I have done it.""Lab results, secure messages, notes, everything you'd need at your fingertips. App runs fast.""Can't get logged in for two weeks and no one has gotten back to me on it""Wonderful, very informative, well set up with very clear and accurate instructions. Thank you""Patient Information app has been very useful.  I am able to share information with my doctors and keep track of all my upcoming appointments""Clunky to click on an email link to message and have to give login info twice begore getting to app.""Crashes frequently.   No option to check schedule of existing appointments.    ...Update: app will no longer allow me to log in.  It sent a link to my email to reset my password.   The security question I chose was \"mother's maiden name\", but when I tried to reset my password, it asked me other questions, such as the birth date of a distant relative (How and why are you collecting that information without my consent?!?!?), and who the previous owner was of my grandparent's house (like I would know that?).""Used to live by this app! Used it daily for my appointments, but the latest update has left me unable to sign in at all. Doesn't even recognize my email address in the help section. So upset! I need this app to work!""Did the update yesterday and when I tried to log in it did at first but going to the patient area would ask me if I wanted to schedule an appt. Powered off my phone and tried again, now it just says authenticating and bumps me back out to the log in page.""Thank you Working well now 11/1/15.    Galaxy Note 4 gives error code 505 when trying to install.""Changed password BUT NO help with remembering username :-( other than that loved THIS app""Galaxy Note 4 keeps getting message: \"Unknown error code -505""The Mayo app provides patients with much needed technical information.  Instead of waiting for the hospital to call and give results, the patient can see the lab work on the app.  Transparency seems to be the guiding principle of the app.  The information barriers  between health professionals and the patient.are reduced hopefully easing patient anxiety.""This is a great idea but nothing will load it just keeps telling me to try again later. Would rate 5 if any of my information would load.""I love that I can access my records/appts from my phone but the new recent update is very slow. I have to try multiple times to be able to see my appts. It takes a long time to load my patient itinerary, the last one did not.""The last update is perfect.   A much better app than before.   You can see health data much better.   Job well done!""    ""com.mdlive.mobile"":     ""It always says my PIN is wrong, although I'm 100% positive I entered it correctly. Using password works fine.""Couldnt register on the app bc of a verification error even with active coverage through my employer. After the manually created the account, im still not able to call or video connect with a provider for an appt they set up or one ive set up. Not sure if the most frustrating pop up message about an error I've encountered had anything to do with it but either way, i'm extremely disappointed in the company for launching a wonky, low quality health industry app that has so much of my personal info inc where i work, my kids names, and birthdates...  And to think the first statement on their site is uncomplicated. I think virtual care is amazing and convenient but MDLive YOUR MOBILE SOFTWARE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE FOR SUCH HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFO AND THE URGENT/INSTANT VALIDATION THAT A LOT PATIENTS LOOK TO THIS APP FOR and I think you should shut it down \ud83d\udcf5 until it's really really ready.   I can't believe you're comfortable with letting people use your app without first testing it 1 million times and making sure it will be a 5 star app.  Sincerely, Group covered healthcare member, healthcare & insurance SME \ud83c\udfe5 Single, working, mother (\ud83e\udd39\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)of three (2 under 2) \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\ud83e\udd38\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f who appreciates simplicity, ease, & convenience \ud83d\udd1b Patient \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0fcurrently waiting to be seen at the local urgent care \ud83d\ude21""I made my account online and then dfownladed the app on my phone and it won't let me log in keeps saying you have encountered an error""UPDATE: I received the admin response. I replied as requested to the admin's response, this was the reply:   \"The group\u00a0appreviews\u00a0only accepts messages from people in its organization or on its allowed senders list, and your email address isn't on the list.\" Your email was not delivered.  I'm not sure how that's helpful.  After spending close to 45 minutes setting up the account, I still couldn't add my insurance. Additionally, after I requested to find a physician to see my sick child, I kept getting an error \"Sorry, you encountered an error.\" It doesn't specify what the error is or how I can fix it. Waste of time. I could've gone to UC for 1/2 the cost & the amount of time it took for me to set it up and \"wait\" for a doctor. This app is in need of some major help.""Don't waste your money.  I spent all evening on the phone to get set up. They say that cold and sinus infections are things they can help with, but the doctor told my wife he couldn't diagnose her because he couldn't look in her ear. Charged us anyway. If you know you can't diagnose without being seen, then you shouldn't base your business on it.""This was my first time using the app and it was a great experience. It was convenient and the doctor still made it feel personal and was very helpful and informative. Will definitely be using the app again!""Horrible experience.  I've used Doctor on Demand over the past few years. Changed because of insurance.  After waiting several hours, I get a doctor that tells me I need to give my sinus Infection a few more days. She refers me to read some medical journal about antibiotic over prescribing. I ended up just going to urgent care. Sinus infections don't just run their course! Hence, the fact it is an infection. Now, urgent care and it has developed into an upper respiratory infection. I will go back to Doctor on Demand and pay out of pocket. Not a good experience!""Long wait for video call but sooo worth it! I would have had to wait a few days to see a doctor and have a very busy schedule.""I spent over 2 hours trying to get this app to work.  Their customer service number kept hanging up on me and when I finally was able to speak to someone, they told me I had to download VSEE in order to have MD Live to work.  As I was setting up my account with the rep on the phone, she hung up on me.  Never again!""This app is horrible! As we speak I have been waiting over an hour for a video consultation. Did this once before and got the same result. Plus they keep robocalling me to ask if I want to switch to a phone consultation. If that's the case why even offer video as an option? 1 star, bad business.""Here I sit 2 hours after my call and my pharmacy still knows nothing about my prescription. I called MDlive back and was told that \"someone will call me today.\" I could have paid $20 to go to my Dr and have my prescription by now, instead I paid $59 and I'm chasing a prescription with no answers. Unacceptable. I tired this on demand service due to the reviews, but I am very unsatisfied. 2 hours and still no RX called in?!?""Its easy and convenient. There is a wait for the actual appt but you just wait for the call back.""Tried to create account it can not find me in system. It was supposed to be an added benefit through my insurance company...""This place is a joke. The app, nor website phone or video work. So I called. Told Doc \"would call 30 mins up to 90 mins\". I received my call 4 hours later. You get calls every hour stating you are still in the que and are next In line. Doc called I really liked her. She called me in medicine and asked what time they opened I said 9am. She said I really don't want you waiting that long is there a 24 hour pharmacy? I said yes there is. She ok look up the address and phone number.  Then call back to customer service and they will send it in right away. I said so I don't need to wait like I did for you to call? Her: no they do it right then. So I call to do that. 30 mins later no call back so I call they had sent it to the orginal pharmacy that the doctor didn't even send it to. Finally almost 3 hours later I got a call that my med was called it. There communication definitely sucks. Cingna really needs to Re think using and promoting them. So if you are ok waiting a whole day for relief while you have it coming out both ends use them, otherwise go elsewhere!""Video conferenced with Dr at insurance recommendation. Dr told me I was sick and deal with it and call back if needed. Called back. MDLIVE said it would charge me again even after Dr request. Had to go to a real doctor to get fixed. Waste of time and money.""I could be dead (or at least my phone will be) before i get through the login. There should be a red emergency button that gets me through to a dr - without requiring i reset my id, password, pin number, security question, and then reinstall app each time.""an absolute joke. never more than 1 or 2 physicians online, and are usually 'with patient'.  I requested an appt. with that Mary woman and she never bothered calling back.""Their service is terrible, once you request to  be seen by a doctor, you have to wait between 1 and 6 hours for them to call you back. They never send in the prescriptions on time, it's been at least 3 times when I've arrived at the pharmacy and they prescription was not sent in. They even charged me 2 times on my CC even when my insurance have them for free.  Please save yourself a big headache and stay away from this app. If you could better get another doctor On Demand app instead.""Fast & efficient! No wait time! I will never go back to the old way of calling a doctor's office only for them to over schedule everyone, leaving you to wait hours to be seen.""Works great. First time using and only took a half hour to setup and get a call back from a Dr. Way faster than the alternative of going to a Dr office.""Complete scam. Waited over 90 minutes before I got a call back. By then I was someplace where I couldn't take the call. Charged $30 anyway. Avoid completely""Multiple bugs. Credit card process poor.  Application hangs when trying to load video conference. Called tech support twice. UI has mispellings for US market. Very frustrating.""Application Still Terrible 2 years later with terrible username and password requirements. Account locked can't reach customer service. What a terrible application.""Asks if you want a phone consult because they are busy and then they try to do video anyway after it says to close the app and you miss it. They also tell you they can't treat minors for conditions listed even though the app lets you select them.""I cannot log into my account - it is making me create a new account.""This is an awesome app. It's changing the game and the way that medicine is done. House calls are back""Can't login.  No button to submit and it doesn't allow special character's. The login I have is an email address.  Why does it not allow login with email??""I can't even create an account \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21""If I could give this no stars at all I would... I called and told the man I was sick told him my symptoms and told him ive already taken over the counter meds. He says he isnt going to prescribe antibiotics. So I told him ok well that is my current situation I also wanted to get back on my sleeping pills and I have my old prescription and he informs me at this point after I had already paid that this company can not prescribe any sleeping pills or antidepressants and a bunch of other things over the phone... so I would say they effectively scammed for my co-pay and my insurance. Do not use these people goto your primary where you can actually get things done.""I cannot log in with my account on the app but can do so without issue on the website, customer service was unable to assist.   Samsung galaxy s7.  \"you have encountered an error\"""Can't log in to my account. It's forcing me to create a new one.""It seems great until it doesn't accept any of my payment cards, all of which are valid and have money. I think it's a glitch""This app just doesn't work. I cant sign in, I get sent password resets, I create a new one but the app won't accept it.""Easy to use had other than adding credit card.  had to select hamburger tab and added it in that way.""try to make my account to start and it will not let me in""I had to use the webpage because the app wouldn't accept any credit cards even though I tried 4 different ones. The webpage worked great and doctor called in 2 mins. Great experience though website, bad experience through app""The app worked fine after i set up my information through its web page. Its a good app""Made my wife wait one hour. Called them, they said a doctor would be available shortly. They called back and said there was no one available for seven hours. Thanks for wasting or time with bad programming.""Horrible!! They'll take your money then after hours of waiting they will tell you there is not a provider availiable. They said give it a month to get money back. Im not going to hold my breathe!""Can not log in to mobile app.  Website works fine, even from my phone, but the app does not.""Download the app, got hung in registration when the app said there were no pharmacies in my area and showed me a map of Africa.  Called the 800 number and a very nice agent finished the registration and set the appointment for about an hour in future.  We logged into the app 10 min prior to the appointment.  At the appointment time the screen shifted to \"waiting for provider\".  After another 20 min the screen changes to \"this appointment has been canceled.  Please reschedule. .\"   My wife could have easily driven to minor emergency and got back in the time we wasted on this.  I called to get a refund and another nice person said the refund may take 30 days even though it only took 5 minutes to charge my card.  About 10 minutes later we received a call from MD Live saying we had missed the appointment.  When I told her what the app did she just said it just does that sometimes and apologized.   Nice people;  app needs MUCH more development.""Ive used mdlive several times and couldnt get the video but they were quick to call me back for phone consultation and very good customer service and got my meds everytime""Worked for me.  Is great and they called me back fast and got meds.  Thanks.""Don't waste your time or money. They were over an hour late, the call lasted maybe two minutes. The poor excuse for a doctor told me to wait a week and call back if I'm still sick. No meds. I will never use this service again.""Set up my account and went to get an appointment and kept getting internal error for my payment. Tried two different cards.""Is this amateur hour? App bugs out on every step, medical 'professionals' with not-so-funny account names and monikers, and you have to pay but MD live seem determined to not give you pricing information till after you use it. I get this as a benefit and the only time I was happy with this is the uninstallation process. Be professional people! When someone is ill, they don't want to pick from childish individuals. I think I would be better off at a 24-7 clinic or just browsing a medical aisle.""Your website sucks could never get it to work it said my card not mapped and doctors never available""Seemed like a good idea, but the app did not sync any of the information I entered from the mdlive website. Entered info again but transaction did not go through using the app.""The doctor was helpful, friendly, and genuinely concerned about my illness. She provided great service and information about how to feel better and how to prevent future development of symptoms.""Bugged out a bit (seemed like it was trying to load webpage after signing up) tip: confirm email and resign in after closing app and it should work as intended. Downloaded app, verified my information and spoke to a doctor in less than 30 minutes; received medicine is less than an hour. 5/7 perfect score""Deleted app. Just like others below it will not let me pass the credit card information screen. Either continuously asks for expiration date (which is entered) or just freezes.""Called because my daughter was sick fever sore throat sinus cough and was getting worse. After finally getting through and getting a doctor to call me back told bed rest. Less then 24 hours later I am in an ER and several hundred later she is very ill and can't hear the head cold went to her ear burst and was draining puss and infection and she is not able to hear out that ear. Hopefully once the infection clears she will. MDLive biggest waste of time and more of a danger than anything to the patient.""It has repeatative connection time outs. Won't save information and will tell u to call their number for everything. I can't even seem to add family members and when we do call they tell us the account is working and active. It's like this everytime and my wife has to have someone manually input her info over the phone. Last operator took over hour and 1/2 and couldn't hear or spell anything.  She has to repeat stuff like 12xs to her slowly.  MD live needs to overhaul their app and online system!!!""The app has several showstopper bugs.1. unable to paste password in most of the time when logging in. 2. Unable to use pin number when logging in a second time (just spins). 3. When filling out CC expiration the month field can't be set until after the year is.   This is on a Nexus 5X. You don't get any closer to official android than that. MNy other problems. Very poor.  How this passed QA boggles the mind. If they have so many UI issues, one has to wonder if their security isn't as patchy.""The app would receive 4 stars, but the service doesn't even deserve 1 star. Due to my insurance's request, I pre-registered everything with MDLive so it would be quick when we needed it. I forgot my password and after ONE TRY they locked my account. An hour later they had it unlocked and we made an appointment. They said they will call back shortly. Shortly, in MDLive speak, means 2-3 hours. Once they called, we explained the issue (basic infection) and the doctor said that we will need to see a regular doctor because it was out of his area of expertise (a basic infection?!?!?). Without revealing details for sake of my wife (the patient), he told us a few instructions to do until we saw a doctor. Those instructions, according to WebMD and the doctor we saw, would have guaranteed her a trip to the ER and possibly a hospital stay to fight a much larger infection.  This service is ridiculous. They take your money and run.""My wife has used this app twice. Both times the prescription never got called in and so we had to call back each time. This morning we had to call in three times this morning just to get my wife's to work. Very frustrating. Took two and a half hours just to get it to work. Crazy!!? I will use a different service from now on.""I am consistently getting stuck on the signin/up/enter pin screen, I have an account that I can access on the web, this should be straightforward.""Couldn't get the sync my wife's account with my account password issue's username issue's it sucks whoever the person was that set it up should be fired!""All my information is wrong even though straight from my card AND get rid of the scrolling calendar to out in a bday. I mean, NOONE using the app was born in 2016 or the 10-15 prior. I just LOVE scrolling forever to get to my birth year.""It memorial day and I have a ear infection.... I used this app got with a doctor in about 10 mins and picked up my meds at a 24 pharmacy in 30 mins""Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still fails with error code -505""I signed up as this was a coverage through my health insurance and I never received any call back after 1 week. I suggest using Dr On Demand, they answer you when you log in.""Web site and app look great, but that is all MDLIVE has going for it. Service is terrible. TRY THE MANY OTHER OPTIONS  BEFORE THIS ONE! Scheduled an appointment with a Doctor. They never called or emailed me. After an hour past my appointment with no word from the Doctor, I called Customer service and they said, and I quote \" Sorry, I'm just an operator. All i can do is take your name and number and  MAYBE some will get back to you.\"  So I waited 4 hrs. Still no contact from a Doctor or any representative at MDLIVE. Very disappointed in your Service""Told us we would get a prescription, was never called in to the pharmacy. Talked to 3 separate people, was told we'd get a call back in 5-10 minutes. The 3rd lady had the nerve to say, \"I hope your daughter feels better.\" Well, she'd be a LOT better if she had the prescription...jeez""It took hours before I got a call back, and the doctor I talked to was barely present. Two fifty cent ibuprofen would have been a better choice""I called to get registered and they say they will call back in 5 mins to set up.  6 calls and two days later nobody has called me back yet. Same thing every time, 'sorry but somebody will call you back in 5 mins.'""I registered, a Dr called me in less than 5 minutes. I couldn't hear the Dr on the phone call. Called the number back and they put me through to another Dr. Answered questions about my symptoms and a RX was called in to my pharmacy. I don't have insurance right now so the $49 fee was well worth it. Certainly beats scheduling (and waiting on) an office visit. I'm very satisfied with this service!""I can't even begin to say what's wrong with the app, but it was painfully unintuitive to use.  As far as the service goes... well I waited over an hour for a call back. There was no guidance when requesting the appointment about how long I would wait. I finally got a call from someone else and they said I would get a call in the morning when the \"computers weren't down\". I'll give it a try again before I chalk it up to another silly Cigna gimmick.""I used this when I had a medical issue and was too busy at work to go to urgent care. The doctor was great, I had instant help and a prescription was waiting for me by the time I left work.""    ""com.americanwell.android.member.amwell"":     ""I used Amwell twice before. It went really well. I needed to speak to a doctor on something that Amwell promotes. The doctor I got was very, very sick! Couldn't stop sneezing, coughing, and wiping his nose. He just kept coughing while I was talking to him. He cut me off about 5 mins at said he couldn't help me.  I called customer support. I spoke with Drew. Informed him of the problem. He said, I see you spoke to the doctor for a few minutes. I said, yes, but most of it was him coughing and blowing his nose. He said, what do you want me to do.  I didn't even ask for a refund. I said, just let me talk to a different doctor. He said, sure, but you will have to pay for it. I called my credit card company and did a charge back! Will ever use it again!!!""This terrible app is a total waste of time. You have to re-enter the same information over and over again. By the time you fill things out again, whatever doctor was available will have a long line of patients. Just today I was waiting on a doctor for over an hour only to find out that she'd gone offline. It would have been much faster for me to stop by the doctor's office that to wait over an hour and a half to connect with a doctor on this worthless app. Don't waste your time with it.""It was very easy and the doctor was very professional, I like that the overview can be emailed immediately. Very convenient, saved me from missing work.""Had to start over a few times. Enter your service key when setting up account, or you have to start over.  When you start over, close app completely. Make sure your WiFi is on, if you plan to use wifi., before you start.  Still, great savings of money and time (even with restarting).  Doctor seemed knowledgeable, and took time to explain very well.""Can't express how easy this is! I don't have to drive anywhere when I'm too sick to do so anyway. The doctors take action and do their best to actually treat effectively every time. So many times I've sat in a clinic with people coughing all over, only to have the doctor say, \"meh, it's the flu, nothing can be done\" and send me home, only to have me boomerang back in a few days with a sinus infection! $600.00 later to get the treatment I should have had in the first place. Amwells doctors treat the FIRST time and resolve the issue! Amwells doctors seem cutting edge as well. Thank you, Amwell, for letting my family stay at home and get competent medical care!""I love this app. I had an asthma attack and I was able to get prescription within minutes""First, it's impossible to send an email because you can't select a contact or a type since drop down boxes don't work. Second, why should anyone use this service if the doctors can't prescribe meds. This was a waste of time and money. I was not told they could not prescribe meds before paying. Under services, Amwell specifically advertises that hormones could be prescribed for my condition. PLUS I was referred to Amwell and a pharmacy at the same time. This appears to be a scam.""I used this for the first time last night. Got a diagnosis, Dr. told me she would send a prescription to my pharmacy. Pharmacy has no record of it. Now I am stuck waiting for the customer service line to call me back. The line says \"most calls are returned in 15 minutes.\" It has been an hour and a half. AND she failed to diagnose or discuss my very obvious pink eye, which I had included in my symptoms. Felt rushed and couldn't get a word in.""App constantly freezes while entering data. Can't get an appointment due to this.""Easy to use. Great for a busy schedule.""They have difficulties getting the prescription information to the pharmacy, and the customer service is completely incompetent.""So easy. A good value.... UNTIL there was a mistake on an antibiotic at pharmacy. Pharmacy got a voicemail and no way to talk to actual person. I called customer care and was told it'd be an hour or two before someone could clear up the situation. The pharmacist called the customer care number and then  they said I had to get on phone. I asked for mgr, put pharmacist back on phone. We were told it'd be 2-3 hours before someone could help with script. Unbelievable!""After spending an hour trying to get into two different retail clinics I thought I would have to make a traditional doctor's appointment and wait a few days to be seen. This app is awesome! I got my prescription and consult with the doctor in less than 20 minutes of downloading. She was thorough and informative, not to mention kind! It was also significantly cheaper than the clinics!""Service is horrible. 2 twice we have used this app and both times it was bad.  Still waiting to hear back feom them no prescriptions are available at the store and no way to get ahold of anyone.  Then I finally got through it said no doctors were available.  Wasted a half hour.... they said a doctor would call me back because we were disconnected again. Have heard heard back from anyone...""Extremely convenient for appointments but slow on getting you your prescription. After three hours, I had to call they told me it would take another two to get it called in to the pharmacy. 5 hours is way too long to to wait for a prescription!""Darn thing kept locking up whenever I hit the back arrow or when I finished inputting information and hit the button to continue. Or when I hit the little info button. Had to kill the app several times because it was just making the spinner turn and nothing else for several minutes. My phone is pretty new and has 4 gigs of memory and is pretty powerful. I can't blame the phone. I gave up on the android app and installed the ios app on my old iphone. The iphone app works very well unlike this one.""Very efficient, informative, affordable! Very user friendly! My physician was top notch!""Getting constant \"the service is unavailable\" errors ever since putting my CC info in and waiting in line for a doc.  Never got to see a provider, so I certainly hope my card was not charged.  Now, not even able to log in due to this error.  Maybe their server is down, but I'm not married enough to this service over any other to wait and see.""WARNING DO NOT USE. DR Stiles and Amwell block my legal blind daughters equal access to medical and even called state and endangered her safety of her hurricane damaged home, knowing her door blown off in hurricane. Multiple federal law contract violations and libel, hippa violated, ADA and more. THIS medapp is EVIL. THANKS for the HUGE lawsuit Amwell and Stiles. You are a disgrace. Abusing hurricane victims, esp disabled!! You are EVIL. NO labs done as prescribing antibiotics without testing, too""For my busy lifestyle this is the perfect fit..""This service is absolutely the best. I have been able to use it twice in the last week for two of my kids that had earache, sore throat along with runny nose and congestion at times. Super fast, was able to see the same doctor for both visits and came with an excuse for school. Literally took less than 10 minutes. I would have been at the doctor's office for hours waiting for them to work us I to the filled schedule. Never had to leave my house. Doctor was able to look into my son's throat with good light that we got from right outside. Another added benefit is the cost. With my insurance, we only have to pay a $5 copay. The antibiotic script was sent to my local pharmacy of my choice and was ready in less than 30 minutes after seeing the doctor. I am a registered nurse and I was very impressed and will definitely be spreading the word and recommending this service to my family, friends and coworkers. The one thing I forgot to mention is that the first time takes a little longer due to the fact that you have to set your account up. If you have insurance, make sure that you have your ID number so it can be verified and if you have a copay, it will set that up for you. If you are using a desktop, which I did for the first visit, there is a download and then it test your computer. For the second visit, I used the mobile app, and it worked just as good as the desktop. No problems at all! This service is awesome!""I do not recommend Amwell, although it sounds convenient it is best to see your local doctor.  I have utilized this twice the last Dr. informed me that I was given too much of a medication from the previous Dr. for acne, in which it didn't work and informed me that I would have to see my personal Dr. for any prescription.""Quick easy and Doc Caverhill was very polite and informative""The DOB does not allow you to type in your DOB and presents a calendar in 2016 and expects you to scroll back.  Not giving up my age, but that is too much scrolling.  This needs to be fixed.""Don't get me wrong the doctor was very nice, polite, and competent. technically, the app needs work.  The video of my doctor did not work, and entering information is tedious and buggy.""Stupid input for birthdate.  Shows calendar of current date.  Expects you to scroll back one month at a time for your age!  That's about 750 months for me!  What clown spec'ed this app?""Dr. was knowledgeable, nice and informative""Great doctor help and informative. Love this and so easy to use""Look at the number of 1 star reviews. Waited 45 minutes. Got disconnected first time without even seeing the doctor and it said I was charged. Had to wait again to make sure I wasn't charged. Never connected to a doctor. Finally went back to doctor on demand. More expensive but this was a complete waste of time and energy. Avoid.""very friendly and informative about your health issue. i learned alot about my anxiety""Slow to get started but once the provider came on it was great...better than urgent care""Nice and easy experience after you fill out the necessary information""These people complaining about scrolling back to birth year are dumb. Just tap on the year and it pulls up a wheel.""Took off two stars because inputting my birthday was ridiculously time consuming. Having to scroll back month by month to the 1970s instead of allowing me to input the date is idiotic. The rest of the experience was great.""Dr was very friendly and informative. Very easy to register and use app. Saves hours of time at Urgent Care!""Can't use it. What developer thought it would be convenient to scroll back 57 years - 684 swipes - to enter my birthday? I don't have that kind of time.""I liked the Doctor.  She was very helpful.  It was very easy to use.  The reason for 4 stars is because it is ridiculous that to get to the year of your birth,  you have to scroll all the way back to, lets say, the 40's.  You should be able to just type in the date.  Then if you are on your spouse's insurance,  you also have to scroll all the way back to their birthdate.  Just ridiculous!  They need to fix that!""

When I called, they were unavailable. They would not return calls or emails. After a few days, I finally got in contact with them and they recommended that I review my receipt in store and call them to have my coupons applied any time I am checking out. They then explained that there was nothing that they could do because I did not contact them immediately about the coupons. I quoted the time stamp on my calls and emails and all the representative could say was \"I see that.\"  Don't waste your time on this app.""I tried several time to get registered for this Account,cause I like Couponing.Don't know Customer service Number to reach out to them.Could someone let me know what going on""Can't set up anything. Very slow. Need to recreate the app.""The slide to clip coupons method should be changed. Very shaky hands & a sensitive screen.  Most coupons take multiple tries.""Fortunately, the app didn't give me any issues about setting up a new Fred's account. Blew through that with ease. \"Clipping\" the coupons on the other hand was a nightmare. The screen on my phone is very sensitive so the screen would end up moving up or down slightly when I swiped sideways.

Also, the search feature for finding the correct email address for your doctor does not work properly. If you try to look up \"Dr. David xxxxx\"  the app will not recognize the name or any variation of the name that makes any sense.

The scheduled update now works on my phone. But that doesn't excuse support.  Email was ineffective.  Phone support was the worse I have ever dealt with.  The guy was obnoxious, rude and condescending.  Those were his good traits. Seriously, the guy should be fired.  It wasn't lack of training or knowledge, it was outright, intentional nastiness.

I would reinstall it, but it seems now you want access to to much information.""I  like the old format.  I could choose a body system for the medication  or type in drug name.  You took away my choice of picking a body system.  In your old format, once choosing a medication,   I gad ALL the information I needed, adult and ped. dose, adverse reactions,  drug incompatibility and pharmaceutical information.

The site is so slow I spent a couple of hours trying to see a doc. Finally it said I was next and to think about what I wanted to say.  30 minutes later I was disconnected. I spent another couple of hours trying to get back to where I was. It kept disconnecting.  I finally gave up and went to the walk in clinic. What a waste of time.  Maybe it was just a bad day but it was my first attempt.  I will give it one more chance in the future.""App setup crashed while creating a profile, specifically when I opened an information block to make sure I provided the right number on my insurance card.

I chose to use the computer instead. This service is covered under our insurance. I assumed the call would be timed, but it wasn't and that allayed our anxiety considerably. We contacted them because my husband has been sick and there are no local doctors available.   We met Dr. Amy Veale. She was incredibly courteous. She heard what we had to say and offered her opinion based on us telling her his symptoms and showing her the inflammation using our webcam and the phone flash light. She said it looked like he was in need of antibiotics and diagnosed it as a blockage of the salivary gland. An hour later we picked up our prescription. We are not sure if the diagnosis is correct but she also gave us good advice as to who we should contact in case we needed further help. At the end of our very satisfied phone call, they emailed us a transcript of her notes, her recommendations and her suggestions for the future. We loved it and will definitely use LHO in the future!""Kept crashing after accepting payment information""Disount code an more""After collecting all my information app crashes when it tries to make a call.""I will never use this again.

I wasted money that I will not get back.""Had to search for therapists by appointment date. So I uninstalled due to having to go day by day to find a therapist that could prescribe drugs. That may or may not accept my insurance. Might as well just go back to Google searching it. The plus side is the better detailed info about the therapists vs. Google""They ask for your CC info before providing you with enough information on how it all works. It turns out they couldn't help me with my problem even though it didn't say that anywhere when I did a bunch of research and it was just a waste of time. The app also doesn't inform you that you'll be video chatting with the doctor and and instead just surprises you by asking for access to your mic and camera. Awkward, bad setup and pointless.""It's unbelievable how dumb decisions can be made involving an app with use cases around medical inquiries which can be time sensitive.

If like me, you are suffering from the flu and have had a prescription for a couple of unfamiliar medications phoned to a busy Wal-Mart pharmacy. In line, you hand your phone over to the clerk so she can enter your card number to process your prescriptions. At home, I loaded the app and entered three modes of payment, not yet knowing what medications, dosage and amounts had been prescribed. The clerk returns your phone to you advising that your prescriptions had been rejected as unapproved, but a phone number was provided. I called the number, waited several minutes on hold, and then reached a CSR who then went into an elaborate discussion of which areas of the app I needed to visit to enter details of my prescriptions as well as payment although I had already entered three modes of payment. By this time, I had spent a half hour at the pharmacy and it was closing time. I had no interest in keeping the pharmacist and clerk waiting on me and used an alternative, much easier app to pay. When I returned home, I had the chance to enter the details and learned that I would have saved 50% of what I paid, so too bad. Too bad for me and Too bad this app is unworkable if you're visiting a pharmacy and need a quick and efficient app to make a purchase.""I was skeptical about how this would work but it was effortless.

It is easy to use also I accidently paid for the wrong dosage of a medication and all I had to do was hit the refund button and click on a reason as to why I needed to refund and instanaeously it said refunded to credit card on file.

I, like millions of other users, don't have enough space left on my primary storage, so I must move apps to my SD card after I install them.  I understand that users must first install apps to primary storage on Android.  That's fine.  Users should then be able to move the app to Secondary Storage in App Storage Settings.  This app does not allow that.  Sadly, I have to uninstall this app since I don't have enough space on my primary storage to keep it.      Developers can enable apps to be moved to SD Cards.  I understand that there are legitimate reasons why some apps can't be moved to secondary storage.  For instance, App Widgets or Alarm Services will no longer work from apps run on Secondary Storage.  I'm not sure if those examples apply to this app, but again, my opinion is to let the user decide.  Some users like myself will give up features just to be able to move the app to SD Storage.  It seems better to me to be able to keep the app with limited functionality than have to uninstall it altogether.      I've heard that some developers prevent their apps from running on SD Cards simply because the app may run slower.  I surely hope that is not the reason with this app.  My opinion is: Let the user decide.  As it stands, I can't use this app at all because I don't have enough space to keep it installed on my primary storage.    SUGGESTION FOR THE DEVELOPER: If there is not an unsurpassable reason to allow users to move your app to SD Cards, then please change the \"android:InstallLocation\" attribute in your app to allow it to be moved to an SD Card after installation.  If you are worried about a second-rate user experience, then simply pop up a warning to the user of the functionality that will be lost by running the app from an SD Card.""Very easy to use.

Mrs. S""This is the best discount program I've used. And I've used a lot. Instead of giving you ESTIMATED prices at a bunch of pharmacies which are not gauranteed (like GoodRX), you get ONE price regardless of where you fill (the only major chain that doesn't take Blink is Walgreens, but Blink is so valuable to me that I transferred all my Rx's to CVS). Its easy to use, you pay with the app and when you go to pick it up at the pharmacy, your total is $0 at the register. The savings are enormous. One 1 single medication alone, Blink saves me almost $1,600. And they currently have a referral program where each person who makes a new account with your referral link gets $30 off their first fill and you get a $15 per person. I cannot stress how amazing this is for the uninsured, underinsured, and you'll even find sometimes Blink is cheaper than your insurance co-pays.""Had some issues with code tonight""Great app.   But users should cross reference with other discount cards to ensure the best price.""I think that BLINK is the future of medical consciousness; it's pricing is absolutely appreciated by those who would not be able to afford their medical prescriptions.

The tutorials are helpful and to the point.  Two things lacking are 1. the ability to select the units of measure individually for different items such as grams for food, pounds for body weight, and millilitres for water; and 2. It really needs a better scan code database.  So many products are missing its rather frustrating at times.""Love it! However im unable to go back on my meals 3 months back.

I'm 10 years out and really need some support, this app keeps me accountable and focused on my goal!""The food database is absolutely useless for UK residents. This app cannot be used as a food tracker outside of the US, back to myfitnesspal, that won't log your day when it's less than 1,000 calories. So still no dedicated bariatric app for UK residents.""I think this app is acceptable. I think the portions are unrealistic for bariatric patients. Most cannot eat a half cup of vegetables  in a sitting. But there is no way to count eating one baby carrot, which is possible and healthy. Also, the nutritional information is skewed. Updates for correct calories and protein for common whey protein powders would be nice. Also, large eggs have 70 calories, not 72. The options their, if you search. But it's a basic, common food! And, it's nearly impossible to count eating something like a McDonald's hamburger patty, which is common. If I eat the patty, and only half the bottom bun, it could be easier than counting 3/4ths of a serving of ground beef, and which one? There are tons, none helpful- and I still have to guess that I ate. 125ths of a hamburger buns! Still, I love it tells me how many days since surgery, it tracks my weight loss, it reminds me to eat, to drink, has a timer for chewing. Overall,  a good app. A few updates, and it'd be great. I love you don't need to be one Facebook to use this app.""I think the app is very easy to use as well as informative.""Great app! I love that you can change almost everything to the small amounts that I'm able to eat. I also love the bar code reader  \ud83d\ude04""Very comprehensive.

The first thing I thought was the voice is very pleasant and then after listening for a minute or so to the woman slooooooowly explaaaaaaiiiinnngggg thhhhhhhe same instructions telling me nothing but where the settings are to adjust them and what they do.

I figured anything that helped a little would be an improvement. I listened to this as soon as it finished downloading. In short I fell into a deep sleep and woke up rested and without any lingering anxiety. Say what you will, but I've been using this consistently for the past 2 months and I have noticed a huge difference.""You made my panic attack worse with your bait and switch price trap.

I suffer from panic attacks and anxiety and this meditation helps me very much. Love it!""I struggle to sleep at night because of my anxiety. I'm always very skeptical of hypnosis apps but this has truly helped me. The first couple of times I made it all the way through the recording and it was very calming and reassuring.

Insurance processes much faster and payments can be accepted electronically so I don't have to wait for them to mail claims checks anymore.""Once all your information is entered submitting Nationwide insurance claims is easy.""I use this app for submitting my Nationwide claims. It is hugely convenient. The only thing I'd change is the inability to see the submission after it's already made. I had one claim submitted where the receipt didn't make it through to Nationwide and I had no way to go back, identify the claim and re-submit. If I could do this I'd give the app 5 stars!""So far so good easier to take photos of docs than scan and send via email. Submission was simple we'll see how it works.""So great to have my fur babies information readily available!""Love having this information available anytime to me.""Only just started using it. Waiting to find out how well the app relays my claims. I hate submitting claims online via their website because the few times I did, they were kicked back because the CSRs couldn't download or read my invoice images. I then had to go thru the motions of photo copying and mailing them. I don't always have the means to do the extra time this takes. Hence, my claims get backlogged in my own record keeping. And subsequently filed later.  If this app works as it should and saves everyone time including me, I will be happy to bump this to 5 stars.

Which means it is the only thing that may help make an informed decision between right and wrong practice, Life and death situations. Its unfortunate that recent upgrades need you to be logged in before you can access the app.  It becomes difficult for us who are using it in places where internet is not available. I am kindly requesting that you reconsider this approach.  Concerned user""It is so useful for me. it makes it easy to get information about drug.

Honestly can't imagine what I'd do without this app. The only way to access its functions offline is to allow it to update & download data. However, downloads lots of data into the phone memory and not into the SD card which is problematic if you have a non-rooted android like mine. It also updates too constantly without permission. Also needs to be able to search the content and not just the titles. All in all, wouldnt trade it for the world.""I use the app all the time.  Not only is it a good reference for drug information but it is also a great resource for current news and updates in the medical field.  I love it.""Medscape is a wonderful resource for me. I have used it many times as a reference.  I only wish the search tool was a bit more general.  It seems you have to type the condition or term exactly or it won't pull it up for you.  However the information for many topics I have searched is so thorough and comprehensive.  Overall it is a very valuable app.  Amazing to have access to this information.""I use this app in a hospital setting at least twice a week. It's invaluable to me, both for it's references and it's value as a news and educational resource. One improvement that could be made is a button on each article page to save to the article to one's account. Of course, you can email or Tweet or Like articles. But, in most cases, that's to time consuming or I don't yet want to Tweet or Like the article. I just want to mark it to come back to.

Automatic updates to this app only, not the entire flaming lot! Now it won't open to sign in? Network issues? Like bloody hell we're having it. 3.5 G speed Internet, 4G+ WiFi.  What's been fixed?? And it is necessary also to have it on SD card for working in, zero Cellular network locations. Try it in a shielded tunnel environment! Setting it back up wasn't an issue now, but the memory hog, core, for reference tables is ludicrous. Make it a necessary off line application. Working in the X-Ray areas of any hospital is absolute hell! Still no feedback from the authors about these issues, calling is useless.""

Devs, try this and see what happens! Because I did and it never acknowledged the updated entry, instead I just pressed an account icon in the footer and it took me in.

I would not recommend the Resound hardware, simply based upon their mis-integratiin with Android.  To be fair, it's the fault of  general difficulty of the Android ecosystem that so many app developers screw up, but when developing an app to support multi-thousand-dollar hardware, you just should not miss the mark so pitifully, especially on ANY common Samsung platform!""Got an email telling me to clear the cache. That would have probably worked, but I had already uninstalled again; turned my Note 8 off for 10 minutes; reinstalled the app...this time it worked.

Now every time I need to use it I first remove, restart and then install it again. But since last two days even these steps are not working. My aid is not even a week old. I think I should go back to widex as a company such big can't fix such a small issue after so many reviews here what else is expected. I regret my decision of switching from widex to Resound even spending so much extra.  Update: I just updated the app today on 18.12.2017 but the error still remains. I then uninstalled, restarted mobile and installed the updated app but it doesn't work. It keeps giving error please connect your hearing aids whereas on my mobile it is showing as paired.""I had to return the Galaxy Note 8 and forfeit a $300 cash card because the app was not compatible. Now I am getting a pop-up from the app on my galaxy S5 to not install the latest app update since then it will not work on the S5.""I gave it one star because it won't let you give it  0 but I'll tell you what these guys can write algorithms and figure out reflections in sound and make adjustments in your hearing aids and can't keep a app going for more than 24 hours that's really sorry they need to go back to work put in a little overtime. Glad I'm on the trial.""In many ways I like the app. BUT  last update 12/1/17. now app doesn't recognize my aids. Same problem others have reported.  12/5/17 After messing with a delete and reinstall, It now works. I think Resound should have either made the update work seamlessly or told us \"Oh, by the way, to make this update work you really don't need an update. Please uninstall the program, and down load and install it again. \" had to go look for the icon again and put it back on my home page again. Inconvienient at best.

Downloaded this, and it won't even detect my hearing aids. It's like it is a TOTALLY DIFFERENT App. What is goin on? Fix this please, or please get back to me.  This makes me wanna go with a different brand aid altogether. I love my Resound hearing aids. This doesn't even warrant one star. What happened to the old app? It was 5 stars all day?? Kev""Have had these hearing aids for just a few days and the app is great when it works. It's just a pita to connect (Moto G4).  Once connected, it stays that way...until I do something to break the Bluetooth link. Then it's back to square one. I noticed that I can pair in the phone's bt menu, but it's just as difficult, and the app doesn't seem to recognize that the hearing aid is already paired! Androids hold over 85% of the market and resound builds for a phone that only 12% carry. I guess they don't really want to sell their latest device.  Bad for business, that is!""Had a pair of resonund aids for a month. Tried using the app on my HTC m9. App crashed several times a day and had to reboot my phone every morning to get it to recognize the hearing aides. My audiologist called the support line and tech support had us clear the app memory and cache and repair the aids. Didn't fix the problem. I fixed the problem myself today by returning the Resound hearing aids and going with another brand.""I've only had the app 2 days and I lost connectivity on both days, I'm using a Samsung A3 phone and although it connects at first to bluetooth and I keep my phone with me constantly to keep the connection it still manages to loose connection. I was in a meeting today 1st part of the meeting connectivity was great but then back for 2nd half to no connection on bluetooth, re booted, re-paired, nothing the app just stopped working, not the app you want to have issues with when like me you need it to enhancing speech in meetings and conferences which is why I invested in the REsound 3D and this app \ud83d\ude10""I have attempted to connect to my hearing aids several times on my Samsung S8+ but this app does not work, it can see when I turn my phone BT synch off and back on but it will never connect to my hearing aids.""Shows hearing aid connected and then freezes.

The program no longer works You lose all your data and if you(unwisely) decide to restart your profile, you are confronted with a demand to \"enter\" you date of birth. A date of 1999 is suggested, and you cannot enter anything, you must tap an arrow going back one month at a time. For me that meant over 600 taps.  Congratulations to the programmer who chose that - worst software design of the year is coming your way!!;""Still loving it! Been using for about a year and the interface is sexy and it's very easy to use. I really like the way it stores the data. I can export and email directly to my Dr. It's also handy to show him the results right on my phone when I'm in the office with my pants down, bent over the table and he's saying 'ok, bear down gently'.  The colorful charts really help take the edge off.""Very easy to use. I have been using it for a while and have tried others and always come back to this one.""I have used quite a few BP data apps but I keep coming back to this one. Further I want praise the developer for his super quick response to enquiries and his detailed and professional responses, it would be great if all developers had the same sense of support. Highly recommended""Easy to use keeps all data ready to be analyzed.""Easy to use and great functions. Wish it was easier to save and transfer data to a new device. Sometimes it doesn't work.""All great except difficult to upload historical data to new phone.""It's only for add note of data it's not work for tracking data..""Simplicity (daily use) and versatility (import/export of data) is just spot on. Design also gets better and better. Keep on the good work.""Work just great for keeping data on heart. Has ads but not to bad. Really like this one over many others I have try.  Recommend it, if you check your blood pressure regularly.""I have been using this app for several years, and it just works. Simple and clear interface with no bloat. My blood pressure monitor can store data, but this app is far more effective.  I particularly like the graph to get a quick view of the trend. I also like the ability to export my data to a spreadsheet to share with my doctor. It's worth a few extra $ to get rid of the ads.""Good interface, easy to export data""Great App, easy to use and helpful. Only problem was how to print after exporting data.""Such a stupid app. Won't let u in until u enter personal information.""Easy to use with nice interface. Good monitoring results. Ready to log blood pressure. Ability to extract data in various formats. Intelligent reports. Use it daily. Great support from developer with often updates!""Quick easy way to track essential stats. I have a whole year of data at my fingertips.""Easy to use and amazing graphs and export of collected historic data.""just far to hard to use and wont accept my email????too difficult.""Good data base which can be utilized easily. The sharing function is very good.""Highly informative. Very easy to use. Fast data entry. Great chart and table layouts. Easy to read and understand data. This app lets you export/share and even print your data. Color coded readings are a nice tool as well.""Powerful, yet simple and user friendly app. The ADD button on the bottom of the \"Data\" tab should be bigger because now the entry is quite difficult. Please consider this improvement.""\"Phenomenal  Manipulative!\" Generates A Comparative  Analysis  Of  Provided  Data Creating A Visual  Picture Of Needed Interventions,""Excellent app, I use it everyday. I find the stats particularly useful, allowing me to observe tends and readily provide my doctor with my monitoring data. I wish there was an option to leave the pulse rate blank or an \"N/A\" entry though, because I don't always take my pulse rate everytime I take my BP. Still, I give this app 5 stars.""User friendly, with good statistics. Export option is very useful, fantastic way to present data to my Dr.""Works perfect for me and my doctor appreciates me taking the data to appointments""Easy to use. Allows me to send data to my Dr""Easy to use. intuitive. Keeps all my data in one spot. Love the graphs!""This would be good if... His app has promise but the ads pop up after you enter information. You can not use the other features because of ads piping up. Change this and I would reinstall. I don't mind ads if they do not interfere with the app.""Great app, take all the information to the Dr without all the paperwork and not mention forgetting to bring the papers with you, I mean I'm going to have my phone so I always have the information with me.""How the heck are there so many positive reviews? First, when you set up your account, it requires you to enter your birthday. There's no way to directly enter that. You have a click on the pop-up calendar until you get to your birth month and then click the day. It required 544 taps for me. That's just absurd.  When I try to send data or export data to external memory, I just get \"failed to send email\" or \"failed to export data\" or \"failed to send email due to I/O error\".  The interface is messy..  Total thumbs-down for this app.""Easy to use app with nice trending data to assist with how BP is tracking""I like the ease of the app. This gives my doctor the information they're looking for.""Easy to use, good information, good reporting. When I showed my doctor the report, he laughed and called me a nerd and told me to keep up the good work. Thanks for the app.""Easy to use and email my doctor the tracking""I share the data with my doctor at every checkup. He really appreciates seeing a visual trend of my BP and pulse.  Works great!""Easy to use, let's me send or print data for my doctor""Very useful with pictorial charting analysis. Doctors get surprised when they see the data analysis.""If you are a person ( like me) who knows how important it is to track your bp over time- this takes most of the pain out of that effort. It's intuitive to use & understand, and over time will develop graphs & help you see what is going on as only a computer- driven app can. Highly recommended!""I have this synced to an cloud account, when I updated my phone it kept all my records exactly right. Well done , at first I thought I had lost all my data.""Helpful information on whether or not each reading is an indication of prehypertension or whatever the case may be. Archives of previous readings etcetera.""The app is easy to use and easy to read. Data entry is intuitive. The charts and logs are well-organized.""Easy to record data for any date, even past, impressive storage and charts feedback. It allows as many records per day as required. Would give it more than 5 if possible!""Very helpful and a great way to keep yourself accountable daily while maintaining heathy readings. Awesome!""I've tried many many apps for tracking blood pressure. This one is beatifully designed with a sporty look. Aside from that, this app has many more features than others I've tried. The ability to email the data and charts is a terrific feature. There's another app out there that will allow you to do the same, but it's 40 dollars for one year of use! If you're looking for a BP tracking app, you can stop looking right now. This is the cats ass!""This app not only allows you to easily enter your blood pressure, but it also keeps a history of your data, as well as, graphing it.""Easy to use.  Great graphs.  Helpful information.  New version is even better.  My doctor was impressed with the report that the app produced""Great app.  I would like audio or visual feedback when I ADD data to confirm entry.   Also definitions for PP and MAP.""A really useful app for tracking blood pressure.  The reason for not giving it 5 stars is due to the export and import functions.  We all know that the life of a smart device is quite short and it would be nice to be able to easily move the info from one device to another.  I've tried the export function but I get to the point where I select the type (XML, CSV) and then there appears to be no place else to go.  I just upgraded to another device and the app moved but, the data didn't.  This seems to be a problem with most apps though, the developers don't make it easy to move the important information that's stored.""    ""com.singlecare.scma"":     ""Not only is this app user friendly, but helped find services that I was not informed of by my health insurance company to help reduce my out of pocket expenses and save money for services that I needed done.""Can't get anywhere at all. I filled out the form and now it says my account is activated, but it keeps saying my email address is already been used and I can't do anything to get to prescription drugs and prices. What a rip off.""Terrible, worst benefits ever, just walk in to any of these services at any office without this card and the price will be a lot less than Singlecare can come up with. Also app doesn't give prices on any medication i enter.""I called had card activated now I cant create an account says my email is already been. Submitted. Also I cant search any drug prices says that there us a network error so I switched over too Wi-Fi still the same.""Best discount card so far and I've used a lot!! Designed for Walmart so that's where the best price is. Easy to use!""Doesn't even give me a price on my necessary amount of pills & more expensive than other discount cards!""If I could give less than one star I would. This app installs fine and you are able to look up prescriptions, but it won't recognize your sign in if you want to use your existing account. 40 minutes spent emailing and on hold with customer service. Their only answer is to reset your password (even though you can sign in online just fine.), which didn't work.  I uninstalled it.""a card came in the mail..Tried it..My prescription went from $70 down to $25 at CVS..So I figured what the heck will try the app out..Thank you by the way..""It would be Nice to have the Edit on the prescriptions to go back to \" Other\" so we can put our Prescription Amount is correct. Right now you changed to to the highest amount to receive a discount at 180 pills a month.  Please change it back. I may have to look so where else for a discount to use.""I searched around and goodrx wasn't even accepted at most pharmacies either for my drug. I used a card called rxcut found on twitter and got my prescription down from 130 dollars down to 14 bucks. Check out @rxcutdiscounts on twitter their card is good!""This app doesn't do much except show you your card.  It has crashed twice on me.  Searching for providers is buggy and there is no way to sort based upon distance or name.""

Something went wrong. Try again.\" So I try again and get the same error.  I've tried several times over the past couple hours, no luck.

The only good thing is that it has all your insurance info right on your phone.""I wonder what business had in mind when they decided to release this product. App doesn't provide better ux compared to the responsive site. It's actually faster via website as I don't have to type login info every time (credentials saved in browser). Locating doctors (most logical use for a smartphone and the reason I installed) is implemented via webview. Why even release the app if primary use is not natively supported? All you get is failed users expectations, mediocre feedback and hit on reputation.""Not ready for prime time unless all you want is a mobile ID card. You have to repeatedly accept their terms. Find a Doctor errors that file:///android_asset/www/&mleIndicator= may be down or moved. And if you somehow get it to take you to the mobile web, you have to log in and accept terms again. And if that cannot auto find your location it skips asking for location and lists every doctor in Illinois in a random location order.

Some requests take you to the mobile-optimized web page.""Been trying for a week to register, and everytime I select \"Ok\" to agree to the terms (page 1/4), it just resets back to page 1/4. Seriously, can you fix this \"Crap App\"""If your used to a mobile app that easily let's you pay your bill and saves payment info for future reference. ..this is not for you. It gave me a phone number to call to pay with my debit card otherwise if I want to use the app I have to find my checkbook and get routing and account info..Not for me, so instead I saved the phone number in my contacts along with my bcbs account # I didn't even look further in app to look for docs, facilities,  etc, I'm uninstalling now.""The application won't allow saving name or password so there's really no convenience in using it vs the website. At least on the website I have my username and password saved for convenience. Uninstalling...""Once I logged into my account, the first thing I did was try to find a doctor. It's either the cookies or the HTML that's off. The page is confined to the left and is compacted. It's ridiculous that I can't have a working application on my Samsung Galaxy S5 with a Healthcare provider as large as BCBSIL. Get it together guys.""Might have been useful, except the register screen isn't very sensitive and constantly clicked into the wrong field. Then, once it let me fill out every field, it would reset the page and tell me I hadn't filled out all of the required areas\u2014even though I had. So annoying.""Using on a Samsung Centura and find this app helpful for researching claims and a mobile id card option is handy.""I don't know what happened to this app, but i can't even use it now. It just crashes when looking up a doctor. When it worjed it was Simple and easy to use. I was able to look up doctors in various health specialties in my area easily. The app has an option to add a doctors phone and address right to your contacts. My wish list: save for later list (so I can look up more about them at home), link to doctor's website, and display my card # in case I don't have it with me.""And I can't even get into the app any more. First time I tried searching for a doctor, I got a force stop message and haven't been able to get back into the app""I rated this low because it doesn't allow you to manage your bcbsil through the app. I would like to view benefit coverage information, claims and balances.""I like this app but it is missing a key feature. The app has the ability to display my ID card but provides no way to email or fax the card. This makes carrying the paper card a requirement when it shouldn't need to be. Thanks to other apps like United Health for providing this ability to email and fax the ID card.""Needs virtual ID card, plan information, other nationalities. Spanish isn't the only other nationality in America. App of prejudiced.""Same as the website... should at least include a link to the website. Why can't I login to figure out which account type/coverage?""Please ID Card Feature! Other than that :)""An OK start. Needs a few things. App2sd, show ID card, and a link to the website.

Able to login on the mobile site, and on my computer, just not the app.""Called BSBSTX to request a temporary ID. (they waited until December 30th to mail our cards) I then downloaded the app. The temporary card on the app does not match the temporary card which BCBS emailed to me. No  idea now which card to use when I go to the doctor later this week. Also, I have to type in a password every single time I log into the app. On the IPhone version, they have the TOUCH ID option.""The app is really slow,  in a world were everything is so fast,  yoy can get old waiting for it.   And after the waiting it says that it can't  access that now,  try later... The only thing i was able to see were the claims.""This app is stupid, it's not letting me log-in at all.

I have been trying to get this app to work for 2 weeks and it has never even made it to the login screen. It keeps saying there is no internet connection when there definitely is. So annoying when you need information quickly and it concerns your healthcare. Obviously BCBS does not care about it's members at all or they would take some of that outrageous premium they charge us and put it towards having a useful app programmed for us.

Can not successfully even find a dr on this app.""Will not allow me in and does not allow you to pay via credit card unless you have to call in.""I have to open up my browser and go to the full site bc the app does not have the option to pay by card. Only payment option it gives me, is the option to pay by bank account. Lame.""This app is not intuitive and requires that you reenter information the app should have once logged in. The result of lazy programming? Also looks terrible on my HTC one m8 but sort of okay on my dad's nexus 5. You would think an insurance company would have enough money to properly develop an app.""Can't log-in. I changed my password and everything.""The app team needs to step up their game and pull information from the site instead of just providing shortcuts. Stupid stupid stupid app.""Can't pay with your credit card just bank account need to update to be able to use credit card""This is just a link to the mobile site. I can already get there on my own. A waste of time ans space.""Nothing of any value.  No personal plan information.""Put it back the way it was before.""The name of this app is now \"Find Doctors - Texas\" and the logo implies BCBS of Texas, and the version it replaces was called BCBSTX Provider Finder.  So why then when you first launch this latest version (2.0.0) does the \"Location Information\" window make reference to BCBSIL Provider Finder, that is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois?  Also, when trying to edit \"Select your network\" under \"Facilities\" from the \"Find a Hospital or Facility\" screen, the Service Unavailable screen comes up indicating unable to connect to service, even though I have a data connection.  Pressing \"Try Again\" takes you back to the initial \"Location Information\" window and the loop begins again.  Please fix, as the concept of the app is a good one, but the implementation is poor.""Wow - reading some of the other reviews makes me wonder - it's a BCBSTX app. The TX at the end means Texas, so if you're not from Texas, and don't want Texas results, then don't use THIS app. What I would like from the app that's missing are ranking for the doctors by patients; maybe just more information for the doctors than the network, specialty, phone number and address. However, it's a good tool to find doctors that accept the insurance.""The app did not work for me. No matter what I tried all queries for providers ended up with \"No results - Please return to previous screens and make you search more general to try again\". Zip codes I tried were in Minneapolis area.""    ""com.bpakhirblood.bloodpressurechecker"":     ""Every time I try to use it an add covers the entire screen.

Easy to use.""Great way of communicating with the security!!!""It says I got an unread message, constantly alerting me, and THERE'S NO UNREAD MESSAGE! HIGHLY IRRITATING! and if I uninstall the app, it still goes to my text that I have an encrypted message! Please fix these issues! I've emailed these problems and still haven't heard back!""Pretty much as advertised. Simple and secure. My issue is the camera. I can take a picture with the app and it crops it. If I use my regular camera it's fine.   For privacy issues with patient info, I rather use tiger to take and submit pictures and not my Samsung or Google cloud.""Great secure app. The best in the market""I realize it is supposed to be secure, but my company uses this app to give staff the assigned patients for the next day.....I can't screenshot nor can I forward the Tiger Text message to myself in the app. Scrolling back through all of the messages, if I miss my assigment, is a real P.I.T.A.""Safe secure immediate texting""It's a good app to secure info but the messages are only saved for a few days other than that it's a good app.""Perfect for a secured information share""Unable to receive email for verification""Good for confidential msg . But use lots of data""Secure and fast clinical communication between office and all disciplines.""A secure site for hippa information""Caters well to niche market being a HIPAA compliant messenger for clinical applications that automatically deletes sensitive messages.""Sometimes lags when you try to log in. Might be an issue with the fingerprint and 10 code at the same time. An option to allow repeated notifications until acknowledged would be great .""Very functional and makes secure communication with my colleagues in a small community hospital very easy.""Secure. Efficient. User-friendly. I'm a home health nurse and my company uses it for HIPAA compliance.""I love Tigertext so far, very happy with the intuitive interface and secure messaging.""I love it. The only issue is that some doctors feel that this is not safe for patient information. I said that they need to be educated. But I love that app very easy to use and I like the fact that information goes away after 10 days.""Works good to send and receive secure text messages.""Secure texting is a good thing and my hospital chose this system. My most major issue is the nag about the fingerprint scanner. My phone has one; I choose not to use it and secure with a password instead. TigerText has a setting in the menu for \"use fingerprint\" and an on/off slider. I leave it on off. Literally every time I move from one message to another, or between screens in the app, it pops up a nag screen asking me to use my fingerprint.   It also re-requests the PIN every time the app loses focus, instead of something more reasonable like once per screen on or a timer.   Battery life remains a problem - having TT on dramatically shortens my battery graphs, although it's improved from previous versions.""Was good till update. I lost my account know I am waiting for someone to figure it out because I can't log in. Kind of ridiculous since it's a required app for my job.""Couldn't work without it.  Great for any business transaction requiring secured communications.""Great security""I couldn't activate my corporate group because I needed to verify my email.  Despite multiple attempts,  I didn't get the email with the link.  I opened 2 tickets with their support team, both of which haven't been answered after a week.  Crappy service. I am a physician in NJ and I'm stuck with this as its used by our physician group and it's mandatory. Nice attempt of a potentially good app.""Works just like texting but frees us up for secure work... perfect!""Easy to use, great security.""Decent app. We enjoy the security of it""Only issue is ! if the phone has a password on it I wish you did not need the password on the app""Very secure. You can't even take a screen shot.  Great job with the improvements""The app is great, helps maintaining information confidential. It allows for multiple group and individual messages. The one thing I would fix is the ability to delete multiple conversations at once! Other than that I recommend it!!""I've used this app for work it's verry secure, lost of options easy to use deleats after a few days it's perfect for what I need it for.""Great business app""Way to go TT, you've set the standard in Secure text messaging!""It is as promised. I wish there was room for a signature line where I could place a HIPAA disclaimer or if there was a HIPAA disclaimer. Or if there was some notification of security within the message. Also some claim they have to download an app to use it. I like that you can see when messages are received/read. Good app could be awesome with minor improvements.""Great to keep in contact with doctors on call. Safe and secure.""Meets every need for secure, hipaa compliant messaging to communicate patient info, including images! A must have for a successful practice!""Good secure app""We started using TigerText couple  months ago for texting patients' HIPAA information, I'm really excited that we took this step. I see; 1. More Interdisciplinary team communication. 2. Decrease the office staff work load to let everyone know the same information. 3. Improve the care given to our patients. 4. Decrease the time to solve any issues that arises.    Very Happy with this app and my staff love it....

It also doesn't send me the text to verify my phone number even though I've resent it multiple times over several hours.""This app sucks.  It says I already have an account but I don't have the password.  When I click forgot password, it says it has sent me a link to reset it but I never receive it.  And before anyone asks, it's Not in my SPAM folder and it's not blocked.  I hit resend a couple more times...still nothing.  Even tried to create another account with a different email.  That link doesn't come through either.  Done wasting my time.""Disappointed with this app. It wouldn't let me register myself saying the information was wrong...I'm gonna try again and I never got the approval text for my phone number.""Doesen't work. GARBAGE! Entered email/pw, said pw in wrong format, changed it, no luck. Email address in wrong format. Just removed it from my cell. Really Publix??!!""I've had this app for about two months now. It works fairly well. However, I just encountered an issue that's a BIG ONE. It lists all your prescriptions kinda randomly, or at least I haven't figured it out yet. The other day, I ordered something and am now paying FULL PRICE INSTEAD OF INSURANCE PRICE because of the listing issue. This is a serious issue!!! As it happens the item isn't an actual medication that costs hundreds, it's testing strips that cost $50, but I could have paid $4.   Come on developer, get this figured out. It's an expensive thing, I got off cheaply but others may not.  Ok, and apparently the developer didn't understand my complaint because a reply said my paying more wasn't their fault. No, it's not your fault the prescriptions were expensive. But IT IS YOUR FAULT that the prescriptions came up in a weird order therefore making it more likely that an incorrect or expired one would be chosen.    Let me give an example. Medication A was for 6 units at first and then went to 30 units. So doctor makes a new prescription for the 30 units. However your app leaves the 6 unit prescription also in the queue. It doesn't move it to the bottom or give an option for the client to move that to an area where it won't be seen. It's quite easy when in a hurry to pick the first one you see or not see all of the info. You need to have it better organised. If your going to make an app such as this you need to really think about all of the what ifs that can occur. I've worked in a design based business and is all about the what ifs.  If you fix this issue, I might actually get it again, bit it's so annoying it's easier just to call it in.""The app is easy to use. Almost everything I need is available on this app. . There are two features that need to be added to the app.  First is when a refill is ordered, there should be more options, asap or a choice of times for same day pickup. The second thing that should be added is a place you can communicate additional information, or make a request, etc to the pharmacist or to the staff.""Latest Update: It seems to be working great now, and getting better and better with each update. Very useful app! Signing up was not a problem for me. I use it all of the time. It helps me stay organized, and gives me all of the information that I need.""This app claims to be installed but I can't get it to open, nor does it offer an uninstall. So, can't use it, can't get rid of it. Emailed Publix and got a reply that was useless and said to call them as can't discuss pharmacy by email. All I wanted was info on removing app, I got advice that assumes I am incapable of entering a script   or using an app. Not happy!!""Not user friendly.  Can't  scan bar codes or set up account.""I really like it, it has all my medications in order, so much better then adding all the information manually. I absolutely find it alot easier. Thanks Publix's. Hapoy New Year""They should reactivate the pharmacy tab of the old app. Going back to phoning in my refills... Hope Publix didn't pay a lot for the app.""Okay so at first it wouldn't match my information. But if you go into your account and add your phone number as long as the pharmacy has that exact phone number it'll work. Everything else is very easy as far as refilling subscriptions""I like that you've made it possible to scan bar codes to order refills but the bar code scanner won't work. Maybe it's my phone - a Google Pixel - but it's very frustrating.""Why did you change this app?  The old version was better.  Please go back to old one""Having trouble just setting it up want the old app back.  Can't set up my husband's prescriptions on my phone when I am the one that orders them""Doesn't work. Can't add my wife. If Publix doesn't go back to the old way, I'm transferring to Walgreens. The Publix supermarkets app worked great, why change.""It would not accept my information.  Now I cannot use the old system to scan my prescriptions. Worthless!!!""This app is horrible. I hate the fact that I cannot have my daughter and my wife to my profile. It makes it very difficult to get prescriptions filled through the app will not use. Wish Publix would go back to the old method works so much better. Now it's even hard to pull up the phone number.""Does not recognize my account by phone number, which is my house phone.  Requires using Mr cell phone for setup.  It therefore won't recognize me.""Would give it a \"0\" if possible. Refuses to send a verification code and now interferes with the app that DOES work and prevents it from ordering prescriptions. I wish I'd never installed it in the first place.""Difficult to set up and can't scan bar codes on the app to refill. It now takes forever to enter each code by hand. The old app was much better. May switch back to CVS.""Awful! Last time I checked a minor is under 18. Why in the world does my 14 and 17 yr old have to have their own account? This is insane!!!""This app is absolutely useless! It is almost impossible to enter your dob in  the profile, and when I finally completed that, I found there was no option to scan my prescription. Please bring back the original app...it was so much better than this!""When this app first came out it was beautiful, except it showed old scripts that were out dated or where all quantities were used up. Then came the first update and the whole damned app went to hell in a hurry. Whomever writes the code for this app should be promoted to a Vice President position that doesn't require anything to do with app code writing.  Take the app back to original, have an \"app certified programmer\" that's familiar with \"if - then\" statements remove all of the outdated and no quantities remaining scripts using \"if - then\" statements, and it should be a smooth running piece of programming with extremely little or no problems for your consumers to use and enjoy.""I still have not been able to log into my account.  This is not an improvement.   Bring the old app back.""This app is a POS. won't let me enter my info  to get started and either crashes or tells me I'm trying to enter minor, which I don't have. Scan feature gone? That was best feature, now gone. Who wrote this crappy code for the app, should be terminated.  I could request a refill in about 10 seconds,  now I'm going to have to call the pharmacy for each if my 6 prescriptions. Don't think that's help your pharmacist who is already slammed with refills. Inefficient,  and crappy app. I'm changing all my scripts to Wal-Mart or Walgreens.""It doesn't work like the other app, to refill my husband's prescriptions I have to have a whole separate account. Not very user-friendly""Come-on publix this sucks.. No scan feature like you had when it was part of the regular app? Bring back the pharmacy on the old app, it was simple, fast and it always worked.""What an absolute piece of garbage this app is.  It is not ready for public use.  The sign up and activation process is buggy as hell.  The 'connection' to your Pharmacy data is so rigid, you need to be looking at your Pharmacy data to make sure it matches (if all Pharmacy customer last names are in all caps, why not use in the app a ToUpper () in user submitted data).  The date picker interface is not intuitive and very user unfriendly  (can tap on the top year to scroll years, but that is not apparent, otherwise you tap forward or back 1 month at a time, which can make for an unacceptable number of clicks)  I give it one star because using it as a guest, I can still get to where I scan my refill barcode.  Other than that, it would be -1 star (if that were possible).""App worked for me after I called pharmacy. They had home phone, not my cel phone listed. Have to have separate accounts for two adults, should be able to combine on one email address.""Can't set up account because I don't receive the for digit code to my phone to finish the set up.  Too bad.  This could have been a great app.""It is ridiculous to only allow 1adult per account. A useful app would allow me to put everyone living in my household on the same account. If I will still have to call in for my husband's refills, I might as well call in for mine as well.""Spins forever to load, crashes, incomplete information. I am very tech savvy and have used competitors pharmacy apps before, but this was obviously rolled out too quickly and not for consumer use.""The text verification didn't work, and I couldn't add patients to the account. Very frustrating.""Three times I clicked to have this app text me a confirmation code that is needed to complete registration. Half hour later, I still haven't received a code and don't think I will. Now, reading all the negative reviews I've decided to delete this worthless app. Too bad. I love my Publix Pharmacy and was looking forward to having the ease of an app to manage my prescriptions.""Works as advertised. I followed someone else's advice and entered my name in all caps. I don't know if that made a difference. Someone else complained about having to scroll back to her birthday a month at a time, but by clicking on the year at the top, I could scroll by the year. I wonder if people's problems are user error""Wonderful IF IT WORKED.. I stalled this app just fine, creating an account went smoothly, yet when I try to \"add patient,\" (me) by way of entering my Publix Pharmacy Rx# as asked for, the app replies, \"no such patient found.\" I am sitting here, looking at my empty Publix prescription bottle, yet I \"cannot be found.\" This app is an awesome concept IF IT WORKED and wasn't harder than it has to be. Uninstalling.""Can't create profiles. Doesn't recognize me or my daughters info. App. says cannot validate the info. Can't verify mobile for text notifications either. Worthless, doesn't work. Will be deleting after this post until the issues are fixed. Was looking forward to using this app when I saw it advertised at my pharmacy yesterday. All other pharmacys have had these features for years. Catch up publix!""My insurance doesn't pay for Publix pharmacy, my mother's does. I use the app to refill her prescriptions but I can't create an account profile for her, only myself or a minor. Why should I have to set up a whole new app account for her when she will never use it.""Can't find old Rx. No scan tool for old Rx required to add user. Kept old username and password but that's it.  Dob  has to be entered by calendar. Had to swipe back to 1960. Incredibly stupid.""Having the same problem as everybody else. Carefully created account with all the correct info, but when it came to finding my prescription, no dice. Tried all the suggestions, still doesn't recognize me. Love Publix and hope they update this app soon and then I will give you 5 stars.""WAY too slow and crash-prone.  When it actually opens and works, it's very useful. Unfortunately, about 75% of the time, it crashes or takes so long to load that the connection times out when I try to open it, even when I open it because I got a notice from the app itself that I have a prescription ready for pickup. I try to open the app to see which medication and how much it's going to cost, and. . . CRASH/TIMEOUT. If the bugs could be fixed, this app has great potential, but right at the moment, that's a BIG \"if.\"""It crashes whenever I try to add myself as a patient.   Really annoying because you can't just enter your birthday; you have to scroll back decades, one month at a time. When the app crashes you have to enter your birthday Again.  Please fix this!!!""I'm in the telecommunications industry, this is the worst conceived app, along with the steps to complete the application. Seriously, for me, back spacing over 60 years to enter your date of birth? Then it still does not recognize you as the patient, you have to re-add yourself as the patient. I hope you didn't pay someone to create this app.""User experience is awful. For some reason I couldn't add myself as a recognized patient, even though I know we have an account with publix. And the error message returned wasn't helpful at all. What a waste.""For those with login issues, make sure your pharmacy has your current CELLPHONE number or email address on your profile or it won't work.""Doesn't work as many have stated.  Account setup is quick and easy until you enter your rx info...then it can't find you \"the patient\".  Useless and will uninstall until Publix repairs.  Expected more from them.""If there was a 0 star,  this app would get it.  Will not allow me to manage multiple adults in the same account. What a crock!  Have uninstalled.  Hope the old Publix app still works...""You can enter the year manually when signing up if you hit the year on the top of the box instead of hitting back. Oveerall it's poorly design and too many steps to sign up.""Useless. Hitting the back button a hundred times to get to my birthdate is ridiculous. Then inputting the info for the prescription and getting patient noir found! I'm looking right at my prescriptiin!!""It needs to be fixed to where you can manually enter a year for year of birth. I had to hit the back arrow 415 times to get to the month and year of my birth. It defaults to 1980, my birth year was 1955. I could not enter 1955.  Also, I tried entering my information to register as a patient & it said it could not identify me even though according to the pharmacy the information they have is what I entered.""Great concept but doesn't have the ability to send secure or encrypted info through the app.  If that feature is changed I will download again.  One more minor thing, minors 14 or older have to set up their own account.  Can't imagine a 14 year old being responsible enough to go and pickup their own prescription, they don't drive, don't have their own medical insurance (in most cases), or have money to pay for the prescription.""I registered and tried to login and it says invalid login.

Add in muscle function too, quick and easy ways to remember the anatomy. Acronyms and such, this is a very premature app and needs to be be upgraded desperately.

All in all I feel like it is a good app!""I like the app, but it would be nice if it update vaccination and next appointment time correctly.  It shows some of the vaccination/meds past due when they are up to date. Shows comprehension appt due 3 months later than it really is due.

I'm putting in the same information I use when I access it on the computer, but won't allow me to log in.""The app itself is very useful and has great intentions but with my galaxy 5s I'm continously having issues. The image won't display - it loads but that's it. there always never any updates or data from my pet- no previous appointments, medical history, data, scheduled appts, vaccines...etc. so the app basically does nothing. It's disappointing because I really want to use this and would help versus carry my puppy's paperwork with me. I would give it higher ratings if the issue itself is fixed.""Please add the expiration date data for vaccinations""It no longer shows my appointments.  It is really slow.  It would be nice if it could remind me about appointments.  Look at the web site, and do that.""I really like this app and I'm hoping to see more come from it. Nit-picking; I don't like that you can't alter your images once they've been uploaded. What's there is just what stays there. I don't like that you can't alter your pet's information.

I've requested appointments on several occasions and I've gotten a call to confirm within hours of the request.  The only frustrating thing is that I can't seem to get the pet profile pictures to show once I get them set! And, I have some really cute pictures of my three boys, too! :-)""    ""com.usbmis.reader.dadg"":     ""Very informative, I use this for PsychTech program.

Love it and use it in clinicals often!!""Great for nursing students, has saved me so much time on my drug cards.""Amazing! Better and more information than the drug book I was assigned in nursing school. Must have as a companion!""This app is a must have for nursing school. It is great for quickly looking up most drugs though now and then the search doesn't recognize a drug that is in the paper book which seems kind of odd to me. My only complaint is the cost, I would expect the app to be another resource we could access after entering the code in our book rather than being a separate $40 charge each year.""Has everything! Perfect for drug cards and quick access.""It gives good information about drugs. It doesn't have advertisements in the app. It has just about all information from the drug guide book, so this makes it convenient to use wherever.  I wish it were free of charge.""If one do not have an account that means there is nowhere that person can subscribe to your product. Think that is so bad.""I paid $40 for it three years ago - basically like buying a book in a store, pay once and walk out the door with your book. Now I have to pay another $40/year to continue using it? That's like a publishing company coming to my door and telling me they're taking back the book I bought if I don't pay them more. It was very helpful to me and I used it all the time, but a subscription is a scam.""Must have for nursing students and licensed nurses. Everything you need to know in one place. This app makes writing drug cards and studying pharmacology a breeze.""Very informative""Very helpful to be able to search by drug class or individual drugs.  Clear,  detailed information in easy to read format.""I love the website but the app is frustrating because I cannot search medications by the specific medication, only the class. Other than that, it is very helpful and informative!""Very good app only looked up two meds but the information was clear and understandable""I paid for it back in 2008, then it was free all this years. Either way its a great resource. It's a must have for all nurses and nursing students.""Great app for checking meds quickly before or during a med pass. Would really like an easy to use IV interactions checker rather than having to scroll to the bottom of the drug information page.""    ""com.mindifi.deepsleephypnosis"":     ""Used this app last couple of nights and  it worked!!!   Cant remember falling asleep. Only slept for couple of hours but that is a bonus for me... usually 10 mins then awake again for hours trying to get back to sleep.. Replayed it though and had another couple of hours sleep. Had sleep problems for months. Hopefully after using it for longer period the length of time I stay asleep will improve.""Purchased content gone. Directions from website to reinstall do not work. No response to my emails. Very disappointed.  While app is good, the inability to get a response is troublesome. Furthermore, unable to get any info on company. Seems they've gone to great lengths to keep all info private. This too, is disturbing.""Have had 10s of 1000s of sleep /insomnia hypnosis apps no of which have seemed to of worked no matter what sessions ive chosen usually end up back in the app store seaching again its been hard to find a voice that has actually relaxed me or made it easy to relax to I have been using this app mixed with my amazon nature soundtrack and Ive fallen asleep and woken up not actually being able to remember when I closed my eyes without it being a mum and dad to two and having a very stressful plus past traumatic life I will be up till sometimes 4am at times not even sleeping and needing to take medication which i hate with this im able to get enough sleep to proceed with my busy days and be content knowing I wont have a problem falling asleep when night comes around I will be purchasing all sessions as I have most on my iphone but noticed their slightly different which is sooo good more options to try thank you for producing such a beautiful app and thank you for helping me finally be at peace at night""This is the only app that has helped me get back to sleep.""Update of the update:  the app needs to be able to loop 2 or 3 times.  It gets distracting if you don't get into it right away and need to restart.   Paid users could benefit from a new track now and then.  UPDATE: I absolutely love this app.  I have always had trouble sleeping at a normal time and I used to wake up several times in the night.  And when I woke up I would get anxious about getting back to sleep.  Within a week of using this app to meditate my ability to sleep was dramatically altered and I slept through the night without even waking ( I noticed using a sleep quality tracker).  It was night and day.  After noticing this, I bought the other tracks as well as the free your mind set.  These tracks have dramatically improved the quality of my sleep and my waking life as well.  From my perspective, I recommend them without hesitation but it will all depend on your ability to invest yourself into the process.  Self hypnosis can take practice -- especially if you harbor beliefs like 'hypnotized man barks and thinks he's the kind of england and doesnt remember a thing' stuff.      I also would like to see some dream incubation sessions since I dont really want only venting dreams.  Looking for dreams of clarity!!!""LOVE IT! Addicted get to sleep easily now and back to sleep when/if disturbed or woken. Thanks.""4.5 score as the session is fantastic and makes me fall back to sleep.

Youtube is full of similar sleep hypnosis sounds & videos for free. Trying to see if i can get my money back.""I love this app! It really helps me relax. I ended up purchasing the full thing and couldn't be more pleased. Especially the power nap one. It guides me through the breathing and is not annoying at all like so many others. It has truly helped with my anxiety and also my ability to fall asleep or even fall back to sleep. I tell everyone about this app.""This app helps me sleep almost every night. This is one of only 2 hypnosis sleep apps that I have found that actually work. Before downloading this app I had no idea what hypnosis even was. For those of you curious, try it! Helps get anxious thoughts out and replaces them with a whole other, relaxingx peaceful place.  I look forward to bedtime again now. I never thought I would say that, but it is because of the 3 sessions on this app: Deep Sleep, Falling Back To Sleep and Insomnia Relief. I like switching between the three each night. Thanks you for helping my sleep routine become routine again. \ud83d\udc98\u270c""I suffer badly from anxiety and depression and until I found this app i couldn't get to sleep at night then wake up with a panic attack. I was seeing a psychologist and she suggested an app like this and I found this one and now I am asleep in no time when I listen to it. Best money I have ever spent""Disappointing I read the reviews and it sounded promising I played it and as soon as I started falling asleep it ended and I had to turn it back on again I wish you would all do it in a continuous loop it would make it easier for people to fall asleep""    ""gov.nih.nlm.wiser"":     ""Hazardous materials identification""App has the ability to move the app data to SD card, but when you do the app won't start because it can't initialize the database.""The app installs on my HTC10,  but when I open the app,  a message pops up saying there was a problem with app data and to check that I have enough storage space.

It doesn't feel nice to use because the design is very basic. It would draw more people to use it if it looked nicer and was designed professionally. Also I neverunderstood why you can't go back to edit previous days. I think the app is a good idea but is frustrating to use at the moment because of those reasons.""I just found this app. I'm sorry there won't be future changes and I don't see a back up method but I love it. It makes me wish I knew how to work on apps so I could keep it active. Still it is awesome as is too. It just leaves you wanting more.     ;0)""Absolutely love this app but would love it more if it had a mood rater to help understand how I'm feeling instead of me being overwhelmed. This app has helped me through a panic attack and helped me come to terms with the cause so I don't just ignore it and get triggered every time it comes back up. Only had it a few hours and already it is really helpful and makes life with a mental health illness so much easier!""Good app asks 3 good things that happened per day and you can look back on all your answers.""Extremely helpful. Calms you down, remind you of the good memories, and releases all your anger or sadness through writing. Very much recommended""It is good, but I wish there were a way to have an account.""It has given me a safe place for expressing myself and a way to pull back and see things from a better perspective. It also allows me a place to vent on bad days.""Little wins can be good enough. Big good things are great to look back on. Easier than keeping a diary which makes me feel like i focus too much on the negative. However without any legit suggestion, i think some way of acknowledging the negative isn't a bad idea.""Brilliant app to help you think and focus on the positives.

Pretty intuitive and the controls are actually useful unlike the competition where they are super sensitive""Informative""There are all bones information""Informative""Good app but should have some more information about bony features""It is good. But it does not contain any information about the edges and shafts of bone. I also need more information about side determinetion of individual bones.  Overall it is OK but can be better.""very interesting, informative""This is so good according to me because this version is giving detailed information about skeletal system""This gives us A&P students visuals without having to get a skeleton model of our own. Sometimes flash cards and pictures aren't enough. It includes some joints and articulating surfaces. It doesn't include cartilage, but it's great for learning names and locations of bones. Even includes sesamoid bones. I'll be recommending this app to my classmates.""Apple store has upgraded version 5 (two versions advanced from Android version), with email discounts. Android users get shafted. If they upgrade the Android version, I might think about investing. Until then there are plenty of other options. I recommend anatomy learning 3d.""    ""com.ascensia.contour.us"":     ""I love the meter and app, it makes monitoring my levels and trends much more efficient. I came back to change it from a 4 star rating to 5 star because a developer informed me that I can indeed remove my misspelled food listing.""I'm an insulin pump user. When inputting the insulin I give myself, I need more than just the ability to document at the whole or 0.5 unit level. The Contour line is great, but if it doesn't communicate with my pump then I need to enter my data as accurately as possible.""I was not able to pair with Android 8.0. After upgrading to 8.1, I can pair. But looks like the data that was on device did not synced to the app. Any way to get that data synced?""I have been using this app for a couple of months because this is the meter that came with my cgm.This app is very unreliable for recording my numbers through bluetooth. Sometimes i can't get it to record the data from the meter at all and just have to enter it by hand which wouldn't be so frustrati g if it didn't claim to do it. I am extremely dissapointed in this app. It also has a lot of bugs when displaying the date. Mysugr is about a million times better.""I love the app first diabetic app I've used that has been helpful. Sends reminders to me when I need them. Love that I can change the information on my phone and it changes on my meter. It really works I have a galaxy s8+ and the contour next one meter. And its a perfect pair.""It works great some times it stops that is ok I just exit out for a min or two then open it back up it would be great if it was a talking meter for the blind people or make the contour diabetes app a talking app and it works with my smart phone""Meter pairs with my phone but will not connect to the app. I purchased this meter so I could connect wirelessly and keep my readings up to date and this has been a waste of time and money leading to nothing but frustration. Hopefully I can pair this device to my computer so I can at least download my readings to print out since it will no longer connect to the mobile app. What a waste.""Works fine on S8 Note.  Transfer of reading, notes and other info is effortless.  Data so easy to see now on cell phone versus digging for it in the BGM.""Loving it so far! I'm always on my phone, and I often forget to input data on any apps I have to monitor my diabetes, so having it do so automatically is definitely a big help. The interface is also very pleasing to look at but still pretty simple. I'd recommend to any other diabetics!""Update: I have no idea how well the app works since my pixel XL will not sync anymore. When is a fix coming?  The app runs fine on pixel XL and it is Handy I have one big flaw with it though. The app will not let me pull a straight log of the raw data. The only report it will give is a one page summary. Add the ability to print out all the readings in colums sorted by meal time I selected to replace having to write it down manually and it's a 5 \ud83c\udf1f app.""The app crashes all the time, and every time.  It is extremely slow.  The graphics and data summarization is extremely  poor.""I have used it for approximately a week, and I like it.  Pairing with my phone was painless.  Once in a while the syncing is delayed, but so afar it has always transferred the reading.  I have two complaints at this time (10/21/2017). One is that on my Samsung Galaxy 5, I can only see one line of a note.  The text box doesn't scroll.  So,after one line one must escape out and look, come back into the note field and correct or continue typing.  The other is I see no way to delete a reading.  Case in point, my wife wanted her BG checked, but I can't delete that reading, which is quite a bit lower than mine.  Therefore my averages are skewed.  Then, it would be nice to export the readings and notes to some kind of file, preferably a CSV file.""Refused to let me make an account, said that because I was under the age of 30 It required parent permission for me to use the app or set up my meter.   Worthless app and I'm most likely going to return the meter at this point.""Works great, love it so much better than my old meter. Easily tracks my daily readings. Just wish there was a food diary that included information for diabetics. Otherwise great start !""I can't even create an account. Tells me the password is wrong then try forgot password and it says email address is not recognized. The remember email button makes the password visable. This app is lousy.""Nice that it links to the meter, but the program needs to mature.  It needs a way to export data in csv or some other format.  Can only chart 90 days? The program included in the previous version of the meter seemed much better at charting.  Actually in all ways other than Bluetooth, the new meter is a step backwards from the previous version.  No color display, no USB charging, no thumb drive storage capability, and less functional software. It seems like it would have been easier to ADD Bluetooth to the original than to create an entirely new system. Why not ask diabetics what we want and try to implement some of those features? We all different in what we'd like, but there will be some commonalties.""I had to install the one that shows (US) and not the (CA) one cause the (CA) one showed it as incompatible with all my Samsung devices but the exact same app but with (US) installed.  Unfortunately the verification email is never received even after trying different addresses so the meter is unusable..  I am assuming (without actually checking) that the people that make this app are not the same as those who make the Contour Onetouch Verio Flex app since that one works on all my devices and does work well.  In fact, the only reason I picked this new meter up is because I received a coupon to get the meter free if I purchase the (incompatible with other Contour machine ) strips - which, BTW, the machine is always free it's the strips that will ding you the big cash.  I thought the new meter looked neat and since having Diabetes is some what depressing a little newness helps sometimes.  It would seem that this meter might just have to go back since I can't effectively use it. **UPDATE** days later I have used this app steadily and have to say, even though I can't use the CA version on my Galaxy A5, the US version of the app is working flawlessly better than the aforementioned app""OMG. Even the settings have lag that bounce back and this is on a nice HTC. If it is my phone it's an HTC 530 keep in mind do what you will""It will not run on galaxy s4 as a known issue as told by technical support today. There is nothing stated on packaging that it won't work on lollipop. Tech support told me to upgrade my operating system to get it to function.  Thank you for your helpful information on how to check with my phone to see if your application will work or not.  I would like to submit to you some helpful information as well. When you go to download an app, it will tell you that this app is compatible with your device or not. It might help if you were able to support that information on what phones you support.    It makes me think that you threw this app out there and let the buyer beware.""Work's just fine if you take the time to properly input all of the information needed... ALL OF IT.""Interface is sluggish, back button doesn't work, confirmation dialogs are clearly iPhone-styled, and now it's crashing whenever I open it. Love the meter, and the \"average\" expanded graph display is neat, but the app is a drag.""Helpful app but not very user friendly. Needs to allow for more precise doses especially for pump users. No way to enter tenths of a unit which is needed for accurate doses of pump management. Also hate having always to tell it fast acting insulin, all pump users use fast acting.  Otherwise a handy app even for life long Type 1 pump users like myself in conjunction with CGM. Easy to see trends and share data with Dr. Just wish it could be more precise and thusly accurate.""Mixed feelings. Love the app features, reporting, and syncs well with my Nexus 6. I have an unlimited data plan, but this app uses too much data (8 GB in only two weeks). This must be because of the cloud snyc backup function. I just turned off the phone in the Android /setting /contour, and will turn it on only when I want a backup or to send my doctor a report. Otherwise T-Mobile will start restricting my speed soon. Also, needs better, more extensive Help.""Terrible, terrible terrible app....  I downloaded the Contour Diabetes app from Google play store to an updated Samsung Note 3.  The android OS is updated as much as AT&T will allow!  I bought the Contour next ONE meter only for this bluetooth interface app.  The app crashes when launching.  IT DOES NOT WORK! I uninstalled and RE-installed via the QR scan code in meter manual and same crash at launch.  I never was able to get the phone app to work.  I did verify the OS is current and updated.  These gloucous meters are not returnable even to Walmart, WASTE OF MONEY! Grrrrrr!""Installed and reinstalled app several times but cannot get the app or the web site (whichever dispenses the emails) to send me a confirmation email or a reset password email.  Unable to use this with the meter as intended. Phone is a LG G4 with current updated OS.""App is very useful, better than keeping a paper log book with numbers and med doses. Took several tries to add the two meds into the app, had to keep backing out of the app and retry adding the meds.""Which I could use it, but it won't send me an email to finish setting up an account, and now that I deleted and reinstalled I can't even try to resend the email again""Why does ASCENSIA \" Contour Next\" need access to all my PRIVATE INFORMATION eg: Contacts, Location,  Phone, Photos/Media/Files, Camera, WiFi connection and others ?

On Christmas in 2015 he had another 4 hour surgery on his back. They were able to give me up dates every half hour on his progress by using this app. It was very helpful.

Great app. I will use everytime.""I live this app. Some of the pictures can be a little gruesome for the common person. I however find it very informative. My daughter had open heart surgery twice now. The first one she had and this app wasn't availible yet. Although they had told us about it. She had a cath procedure done and the app was. As well as the 2nd open heart surgery she had. It put me and my wife's mind at EASE when we got video and pictures about the performance and how she did during the surgery. I love this app""We used this app for our baby's heart surgery. Truly amazing. The updates, videos and pictures were incredible! Calmed our nerves knowing we'd get information as they went.""Heard about this through a friend & made sure the hospital my wife and i went to was part of the Ease App network. She chose to get texts, images, and videos of my procedure. You can opt for as much or as little info as you want.  Added family members across the state to the group so they got the same real time updates. This app is amazing.  When my wife goes into delivery soon, we will be using this.

I felt too weak to drive to urgent care and the thought of getting dressed + waiting to see a doctor seemed daunting. This was the perfect option. After I chose my doctor, I added my medical history and medication information. The video call was seamless. At the end, she sent over a prescription to my pharmacy and a treatment plan to my email. I discovered this option and started my medicine a little over an hour later. I have not received my bill from BCN, but I believe I will be charged the same as an office visit. Wonderful alternative and will be helpful in containing the flu.""    ""com.dexcom.follow"":     ""Dexcom Follow is a critical app for me and my T1D partner. The number of times it has allowed me to catch a low while they were fast asleep is wonderful. What is not wonderful though is that this app feels dated and uncared for compared to the main G5 app. Please please please add options for persistent notifications and custom alert sounds, home screen widget, and Wear support. I want to be able to have my partner's CGM data on my watch too. Opening this app and agreeing to terms every time makes checking their CGM data take longer than it needs to, which decreases the value of care the user can give to their loved one. Thank you for it though and please update it!""For hypoglycemic unawareness diabetics, seeing where your numbers are heading and having these alarms 24/7 are vital. I've seen a marked improvement in my numbers since getting my CGM and using this app.  My low ratings are due to the fact that this won't work on my phone, which reduces the benefits of using the app. I can't even download it, like the Share app. I have to carry an old phone just to use this app and they connect only within the range of my home's wifi. If I'm outside my house, this app is worthless since it can't be used on my active cell phone.   I need this app the most when I am out running errands. Since I can't use the app outside of my home, I have to use the CGM specific receiver. Which means I have to do double the calibrations, etc. This is more of a nuisance than a problem, but it is annoying and cumbersome to carry multiple phones and receivers just for 1 app. Not to mention that during that time, data doesn't get sent to the Share app, which is irritating too. A day out means people see a blank screen and won't be alerted if I were in trouble.  PLEASE update this app for use with Google's Pixel phones. The first version came out 1.5 years ago, so I hope a fix will be rolled out soon.""Today, all four followers were unable to read the sugar levels from Dexcom 5 Mibile app on my 10 year old daughter's phone.  After troubleshooting for 3 hours on the phone with tech support, I was asked to create a new account (Dexcom Mobile) for her...still does not work!  What is going on with Dexcom Follow???""I don't feel the enough attentions are given to the follower app by developer. It has not been updated for more than a year. As a T1D kid parent, I am very frustrated there are many times I don't get BG data on my phone, while the original G5 app can show the BG perfectly. No any setting is changed, I have both phones side by side with the same WiFi. Just no BG result can be shared to me. I have android and my wife an iphone, neither of us can get the BG from my kid.""Love the follow app on my Samsung far better than the main version on my son's apple iPhone.   Only ONE (big) complaint... The bright orange and white design has permanently scarred the screen on my G7.   PLEASE go back to a black background, or at least give users the option to set the colors. (The bright white/orange also make it awkward in places like the movie theater and driving at night.)""Honestly an awful app. For some reason Dexcom thinks that everybody has an iPhone because all their Android apps are unoptimized and missing key features such as widget and ongoing notification support. On top of that, after several years of waiting, there still isn't a Dexcom g5 mobile app for Android users. This is frankly inexcusable for how overpriced your products are, Dexcom.""Got this back in March of 2017.  Used on iPhone and for a short while on my note 5.  I have a note 8 which runs the same setup as the s8/s8+ (except for ram).  When will this be out for the note 8?""I have a LG Fortune phone and because I can't download the mobile app on my phone I can't send an invitation to my husband about this app. He has to call me or text me and there or times my sugars have been so high he would have family call too until I hear the phone. Y'all really need to make these apps Android friendly for all Android phones. It would save a lot of worry and lives.""Looks like some mixed reviews. The follow app lacks functionality. Data is only as good as how you use it, this app does not allow for much use other than single data point monitoring.    Our insurance covered it all, that allows us to judge only the functionality. If I paid thousands I would likely be more critical.  I need to see all the data this thing has in the online reports, live in real time, I need all the user recorded data, like food, activity on the graph, I need different data views. UX/UI is leaving me wanting for so much more.""This app really needs adaptive graphing. Expand the scale on the initial screen and use a different background color or pattern if you have to expand it over, say, 200. I'd much rather have a finer grained graph than a scale that catches once-in-a-decade highs.  While you're at it, how about option error bars on the data points?""We just started using this for my nine year old daughter with T1 and it is pretty feature-limited. It would be great if I could view individual data points like in the mobile app, if I didn't get \"no data\" notifications during the warm up period, if I could see the data in landscape mode, if I could pan through the data at different scales, and if I could have more than 24 hours worth of data at a time. Also, how about peer-to-peer data sharing in addition to having to get data from the dexcom servers? I have no problem with Dexcom receiving my daughter's data, in fact, I'd like to see Dexcom wade through HIPAA regulations and figure out how to use the data across all patients to mine for medical studies, improved clinical criteria and insulin dosing advice, etc. But what about times where we go offline? It's much more convenient to pull out our phones and glance at her numbers than interrupting her to see how she's doing. I want her to be able to live her life while we do the job of looking after her health.""I'm happy with this app.  My wife has been using the Dexcom CGM System for the last month with her iPhone.  She is getting used to the system and so are my son and I.  I've had the follow app installed for a day now and it is handy having this on my phone.  I can double check on her because sometimes it seems her iPhone fails to alert her when she is low -or she is disoriented and doesn't realize.  When she is at work and I am alerted, I can send her a text to see if she is working on getting her glucose level back up.""I have a love/hate relationship with this app which I use to remotely monitor my son's blood glucose values (G5) throughout the day. Every few days or so it reverts back to an annoying disclaimer screen stating that the app has not been tested on my Android device (Samsung S7). Seriously? I direct Test Quality Engineering for a very large company and while I acknowledge that it is difficult to test on every Android device due to the enormous market of available devices, there are still things that can be done to assure test coverage on newer devices such as the S7. You can automate your tests and execute via cloud services such as BrowserStack or Saucelabs, both on emulators and real devices. Perhaps there is a regulatory requirement  I may not be considering, but again there are things that can be done. At the very least, please provide a way to opt out of the nag screens.""Can't receive emails or invites or whatever it needs to follow directly from the device. I guess he needs to have some other phone/app receive from the device to send it on to me? Such janky software for such a modern device. Uninstalled.""It works properly on my Nexus 10 tablet. Very fast response.  BUT on my ZTE 970 ZMAX phone it is painfully slow taking more than 40 seconds to load readings even if you don't close the app. If you switch to another app and come back to the app it will take another 40+ seconds to load current numbers. If the screen sleeps and you wake it it will take another 40+ seconds to load current numbers.  I thought it was just a very slow process until I saw it load almost instantly on my tablet.  The app is also a little weak on options and the notifications don't show the actual number, just that there is an alarm.   So on my phone in the middle of the night the alarm goes off and says I have a glucose notification for my wife's blood sugar, I click it and wait almost a minute to see what the number is. And this repeats every 5 minutes until she gets back in range. I can't tell the app I got her some juice so wait 15 minutes and if it's still going down notify me again.""A needed app yet needs improvements. The iPhone app is good, this android version is unacceptable.  Alarm choices are annoying and enough to get anyone fired at work. 1 short sound is not an option.  No vibrate option at all.  Does not work if phone is on do not disturb, this should be a setting option.  Do not disturb is for the middle of the night for unwanted text alerts or email alerts.""I'll admit that I'm praying this whole system will be android friendly very soon. Until then, we have an iPad in the house that is on wi-fi. It seems that the iPad can be anywhere in our 2 story home and this app still alerts me if my son is low or high.  I'll be a happy camper when I can see the data when he's away from home but I'm so thankful for what it CAN do now.""Tried to contact the app developers & nobody ever got back to me. I did receive an automated response saying that they received mine, but never anything else. This app works  BUT takes about 20 seconds for it to show me what the number is. Alerts & everything works but it's just ridiculously slow when you just want to see the number. Needs a major update!""Okay #1 Dex has a really good CGM but #2 no support for share on Android?? This company is close to losing at least this customer because they got cheap on the support side. Android OS is the #1 platform for mobile worldwide (and in the US), but Dex only supports iOS. It's not due to FDA restrictions, it's Dex not funding development of the Android app. I wait 45 minutes on hold for their support line because Dex mgmt didn't fund their support dept, they need to jump on this or lose customers.""It is slow to load. Seems like they'd get this app updated sooner rather than later since there are a lot of Android users.""Dexcom...please, please improve and update this app.  We use it 24hrs a day for our 7 year old daughter.  Waiting for her data to load can take 30-60 seconds each time we want to check on her.  We will probably stop using the G5 unless you rapidly improve the Follow app.  Dexcom...this is too important not to sink some resources into the Android platform.""We use an out of service iPhone on WiFi to make the information available on our Android phones. Works great since she's only 13 so rarely away from us and WiFi at the same time. I wish the alerts/alarms did not override the silent feature on my phone. I am a college student and to ensure I don't disrupt class I have to edit and turn off all notifications individually. I would give 4 stars if I could turn them off with one button, and 5 if they didn't override my phone so I wouldn't have to turn them off at all. Silent notifications during class would be optimal!! Also, I know this would be a big addition, but it would be nice to be able to select a dot/area within the last 24 hours to see what the reading was. That might be way too much data on the cloud, but it would be helpful in identifying problems, etc.""The data is great, but the alerts don't work very well. Audible alerts seems to have quit working altogether. Sometimes visual alerts work. Sometimes 5 will come through at once, and 4 of them are hours old. Our IOS devices do not seem to have these issues.""This app worked perfectly on my Galaxy Note 4 before the G5 transmitter! Now I get her readings but it doesn't alert me whether she's low,high or no data!!! She's 8yrs old! I need to be alerted!  I'm a school nurse and get very busy with sick kids in my office. So when she's in her own school,  I depend on that audible alert to alert me if she's going high BUT ESPECIALLY IF SHE'S GOING LOW!! Does anyone know what to do?  Thank you!""App worked great from April '15 until around Aug or Sep '15 - then its load & response times became INCREDIBLY slow.  Now alerts have stopped working (on both my phone & my wife's). We use this app to track the status of our T1D child. Fix this app!""Alerts and notifications stopped working a few days ago,  please fix!!!!!  I finally got to sleeping through the night instead of waking 3 times with my son and now it's back to waking and checking bc sounds and notifications stopped on my Android galaxy.""Loved this app up until a few days ago alerts have stopped working it has stopped showing any alerts or alarming during highs lows and no data I do have an android my son carries the iPhone to share with me and now I am constantly having to load to see what my son's sugars are instead of having it alarm for an issue so back to getting up and checking sugars until this is fixed not sure what changed was absolutely wonderful up until a few days ago""This app worked wonderfully until the roll out of the G5 and the firmware update on the android phones. I use android. It worked fantastically....really upset that it's not reliable anymore. I does not give alerts reliably and it is so incredibly slow to load. Please update on your end so that I can watch my 6 year old daughter and make sure she's safe!!!!""Still have to have a piece of crap Apple device to connect to receiver. May be worth something once they have an Android Mobile App.""Data is lost more then it's working""And they in fact said it does not work if you have android. They said it will be sometime after 2016 until the FDA approve the android version for use. That made no sense to me since both android and apple are linux based operating systems. Also... must have 1 apple product such as \"I something\" with Itunes account to send to an android account on Itunes. Made no sense to me again. I don't know anyone with an Isomething to even test it.""It's misleading the sender needs an iPhone you can receive the CGM data on your Android phone but the person that is sending it needs a iphone. So if the person with the Dexcom does not have an iPhone this app is worthless, kind of misleading. There are way more Android users than iPhone users why would they make a app that needs a iPhone this is the Google Play Store for Android not the App Store for iPhone . Dexcom really needs to get their act together.Also made me buy a CRAPPY iphone to use the G5 app.""When you restart your phone I keep getting no data and I keep checking to see if it's connected to the device and it is  you guys really need to fix this. I am getting really upset that I have to wait 3 days for it to work again.""Works good as long as their is data.  Would love to have more alerts option.  I'm often in meetings and as such keep my phone silent or don't want to wake my wife while sleeping.  I rely on the vibration feature in my phone.  Not the media volume.  But cant set up the alerts to be a vibration instead.""Very glad to have this - it does work as advertised and is stable.  In the future, it would be great to have:  1) Access to more than 24 hours of data; 2) Ability to connect from the sharer to more than five followers (which seems awfully arbitrary and unnecessary); 3) Web access to data (for example, so providers can easily access data).""We've been using this app for weeks. I was going to include pros but space is limited. Cons: only the Apple store Share app can send the Follow app any information and the apple version was released months ahead of the android one. It needs to alert for fast drop or rise rates. Develop a widget and give me more info on the notification. Give me more options. Maybe I want to be alerted at 100 with two arrows down, AND 90 with one arrow down AND 80 every 10 min AND 70 every 5 min. Understand our needs.""    ""com.alivecor.aliveecg"":     ""Easy to set-up easy to use. Lots of helpful information. Great record keeping. I really like it.""This is much more convient than a golfer monitor because you have to hope your intermittent symptom occurs while you are wearing it. I was able to capture my suspected AFib  at 3am. Lucky for me as a Nurse who can read EKG's I knew what it was for sure and was able to email my Cardiologist who had recommended I get this product. And we were able to discuss a plan. Even if you can't read EKG's this is easy to use and the app gives you an unconfirmed diagnosis.""Great app!!! With Kardia mobile, was able to capture much needed EKG of ventricular tachycardia and submit to my cardiologist.""I was hoping for something like the Fitbit, which tracks you heart rate at all times, and gives you charts showing fluctuations. All Kardia does is tell you you're heart rate when you take it and that you EKG shows no abnormalities. No more information about your heart. If I go to a doctor's office and he gives me a computerized EKG it provides lots of detailed information about my heart rate. I can see if there's improvement. This Kardia is worthless. If I could get my $100 back I would take it in an instant.""Having the ability to check your rhythm so quickly is really convenient. The data compiled is priceless. I am \ud83d\udcaf satisfied.""Very happy with it! Very affordable considering the alternative is a Holter monitor... Not to mention you're not all wired up constantly. Although sometimes the raw data looks weird to me (not a trained pro) I've printed the PDFs and given them to my doc. She had no problem with the quality. Perfect to capture arrythmias.""I paid $100 for the device. Got a strange looking reading that the app called \"Normal\". I tried to report it as a BUG and was told to pay $9 to have a clinician review it. That's not how bug reports work, or is your technology 100% flawless and immune from any possibility of bugs unlike every other app in the world? (It's also annoying that it doesn't turn NFC back on.)""Gives me peace of mind and evidence that i can email to my heart specialist.""Every time I use it, I am comforted in knowing how intense the attack is or watching yourself convert to a normal rate. Seeing misbeats and how fast your heart recovers from them. Yes the strip is only 30 sec but much can be captured.""Hap a heart attack in 2008 ever since then when I get palpitations I panic and rush to the ER. been there more then 200 times since but this device helps keep calm. The frequency of visits have gone done dramatically. Thank you for this product""This device has brought peace of mind following my heart attack and has helped me confidently avoid unnecessary hospital visits. I love that I can share readings with my cardiologist. Kardia has been life changing. Thank you so much!""Hated it in a year ago, but it has been consistent on the cloud to my Doctor. It has problems with patients with SVT or Tachycardia. I have noticed the heart rate differs from the Omron 10 BP Machine. I have severe PVC's, PAC's and Tachycardia. I know my doctor is getting the results, he showed them to me at my last visit. I hope it is working and actually pucks up any heart rythem. I will say I got Influenza A Dec 10 2017 and my heart has not been the same since. Major changes, the Virus and subsequent Bacterial Pneumonia changed everything in my body.....Advice, wear a MediChoice Procedure Mask and Vinyl Gloves in public until this epidemic of H3N2 winds down....My Lung Doctor told me on \"This Flu is killing alot of people\" Don't take any chances!""This has been an invaluable tool for monitoring my AFib.  I am able to tell when I am in full AFIB or when my heart is getting near to going back in rythum so that I don't have to take the extra medication the doctor gave me to help get it back in rythum.""Well it seems to be working for me. Has not giving me any real trouble or bad news yet. Had a little problem getting in the right position to get a good signal. I had to slide the metal contact plates up & out of the plastic holder & sit them on the side of my phone. With my phone side ways, the top of my phone pointed toward my left shoulder & the metal plates also side ways, with the company logo pointed right side up, toward my left shoulder also. I put two fingers from my left hand on the left plate & two fingers from my right hand on the right plate. Now slide the plates left to right slowly (more towards the top half of my cellphone) to find the postion where the app will read (great strength). Hold still for 30 sec. The first time it tells you that a doctor has to review the EKG & they'll get back to you within 24 hrs. Took 4-6 hours. Don't be discouraged, by all this explaining. It's easier to do that it is to describe. I just wanted you to know that the app is just a little bit finicky about positioning would however once you get The Knack of it it's not a problem. It does work, well.""Huge convenience. Great to be able to send data to doctor.""Gives you peace of mind and information at your fingertips.  Love it. Highly recommend.""I have been tracking for the arrhythmia and love being able to email the results to the cardiologist.""The Kardia has helped my EP assess my arrhythmias beyond a holter monitor or event monitor. He used the monthly reports to gauge how frequent my attacks were and what was going on. It also gives peace of mind. Have had no technical problems.""Since my A-Fib is intermittent,  this is a great app to capture my episodes. I like the fact that it turns your recording into a pdf file that I can email to my doctor. I paid for premium service and receive a monthly summary of my recordings.""Great to share information with Dr.  Allows Dr. to see what's happening when not in their  office""This does what it says, detects afib. It has a glitch when it says there is interference showing a screen saying rerecord. But there is no way to get back without closing the spring ap and restarting it. Not a big deal but makes it a 4 rather than a 5. I have owned it for almost a month and would buy it again.""Its Great For AF. Any other condition just says Unclassified if you have Irregular Heart Rhythms. Then will Charge you for a Clinical Review By there Cardio Specialist. Think You should at least get a Free Review  considering i Have Premium Subscription plus \u00a3100 for the Device, But Charges \u00a35 Per Review. Still With Premium you are able to do a report for your Records and Email the Report to whom ever yourself or a GP ect. So Good in that respect.""Very convenient but the \"uncategorized\"  readout is useless!....paid the $9 for mini interpretation which most importantly told me I had Sinus Rythmn, along with PAC(s)and IVCD....guessing the rythmn analysis data is captured and could be displayed separately, i.e., Sinus Rythmn""First your commercial  is missleading. I can't access my account. You have to have a premium account for it to work. You cannot see your results. And a cardialigist has to see the results. First one is free. Bet you have to pay for the doctor. Don't buy it. I am stuck with the danm thing.""THIS IS THE BIGGEST HOAX OF A BUSINESS MAKING YOU BUY ANOTHER UNIT AND THEY TELL YOU THAT YOU NEED ANOTHER PHONE AND WHEN YOU USE A TABLET AS THEY SUGGESTED ON THE PHONE IT WON'T WORK EITHER. THE SITE TELLS YOU THAT YOU NEED TO PURCHASE A NEW UNIT. LOOK HOW HARD IT IS TO GET THEIR PHONE NUMBER. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED BECAUSE IF I FIND THEY ARE OPERATING IN THE US, I WOULD REPORT THEM.  BEWARE OF DOING BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE UNLESS YOU ARE SURE IT WILL WORK.I HAVE HAD ONE FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS AND NOW IT STOPPED WORKING WHEN I NEEDED TO TAKE A READING. NO ONE NOTIFIED ME THAT THEY DIDN'T WORK AND I WENT NUTS ON A SATURDAY WHEN THERE IS NO ONE TO HELP ON THE WEEKENDS.  WHAT A JOKE""After buying the unit for $200au I was very disappointed that it would not work on OPPO mobiles. Paying a further $400 for a new phone to simply operate the unit.   The $600 outlay is not good,  better spent elsewhere.""Simple to use with a wealth of information available.""Great aid to inform me about what is going on with my Afib""Pleased with how this works with my Samsung Note 5 but it is essential that the phone be placed in airplane mode before beginning. I sometimes take readings using my fingers but have had very consistent results using it on my chest while lying down and resting the bottom edge of the phone on the back of the device. (I didn't attach it to the phone.) I have AFIB and am glad to have the device and app.""Had mine for about 2 months..not convinced it's reading a correct account of what's going on with my heart..when you try to email it outside of the premium plan it will lock down your phone..tried it on Android 5 and 7 and it's still freezing the phone. You have to restart your phone to clear it. Seems to good to be true.. skeptical..sorry.""What I find is the coolest thing is that the data is being transmitted over sound on a very high inaudible frequency""The new updatedversion ofaug 2017 not working on my mobile. Old version was working fine. How do i download the older version??""Charging a subscription now a days is a crime for all the data you got from us. Not letting us to have the data after spending money? Come on! I will ask for a refund if this isn't fix asap. There are no use for us if we don't have the data. At least make the device free if you wanna charge subscription fee. Plus we don't need subscription to analyze the result if we already have our own doctor. Great tool, but bad business practice imo.""I love the unit itself. It works great. However I did not pay for a premium subscription because I do not need it. Now I can not seem to send my EKG to email. I should be able to send it to an email address without paying for the premium subscription. I already paid over two hundred dollars for the unit. I do not wish to have my EKG's reviewed by their panel or a journal kept for me. I just want to take an EKG and send it to my cardiologist.  My cardiologist and I discussed the purchase of this unit for this reason. I have a specialist I do not want the premium subscription so please tell me how I can forward the EKG to the cardiologist without it.  Thank you kindly!!""Complete waste of money for me. Device worked once and has since shown my results as \"unclassified\" ever since. Paid $19 to have the results reviewed, which came back normal. Unless I want to pay every time to have the unclassified results reviewed, this tool is useless to me.""You should tell us about all the privacy we must give up and the advertising we must accept to get your app before we buy your kardia mobile EKG. I will be returning it to Amazon today, you deceived me thinking I would be okay with it after paying  $100 for your product then getting a free app that forces you to accept unacceptable terms. I will be notifying HEPPA oversight.""It works on pietzo crystals. When they malfunction - and they do, there's absolutely no support or back up. You have to pay again. Mine lasted just over a year.""App works for me and my cardiologist.  However, it uses more background data than any app on my phone.  I can think of no good reason for this.""The recordings are clinically insignificant because there is too much interference even though there really isn't and now it doesn't even work and the customer service won't return calls and has only sent a generic email to find out what the problem is or to try to fix it which didn't work""The sensor works great. The app identifies AFib.  But, there is no way to get the data out of the app, like a CSV file.  If I want to chart date, BPM, AFib, etc I have to manually type that into a spreadsheet.  Not what I expect for $10 a month""If I could give  a zero for customer service I would. After repeated emails and phone calls I received an automated response (with a small apology) and the response did not even answer my question. They have a 'contact us' button. But, you leave an email - maybe when you are in trouble - and you'll never hear back.  It just raises my BP to think of the way people are treated by this medical device company. People would not be purchasing it - unless they need it. Then Kardia deserts us! Disgusting.""Takes too long to start up. Sometimes I feel my heart rhythm skew, which usually lasts about 20 seconds. It usually takes me less than 1 minute to log in to my phone and start the Kardia app. But it takes too long for the app to start recording. Sometimes, 3-5 minutes. And then sometimes it drops the connection. Then, I have to wait another 2-3 minutes to start recording again. By then, my heart rate is back to normal and I'm too upset to continue.  Also, upon app install, I understood that a real doctor was going to read my initial EKG. After submitting it, I never heard from them.""Was absolutely a technological marvel for first thirty days.. then they cripple your $100 device by only allowing you to realtime view ECG.. no way to save it to your phone locally under your profile  Then they want to extort $10 per month from you to allow you to save it. what a rip off. Going to see if I can get my money back...  It would be like Google telling you that you can only view photos when you take pictures with your phone and not allowed to save it locally unless you pay them $10 per month...""I don't know if it is just my phone, but I can't take screenshots anymore?? PLEASE bring that back, it was the only way I could properly get the information to my mom. [I'm 16 years old] Who is at worl for most of the day. And i generally need to get this information to her ASAP and my body is too weak or shakey to properly type everything. Yes i could call her but then she can physically see the EKG. Screenshotting it was the easiest and quickest way for me to do that. Other than this the app is great but I honestly wont be able to use it if i cant take screenshots of it when necessary. It says I'm unabke to take a screenshot ue to the Privacy policy, but its MY heart rate? I should be able to take a screenshot of that. Please bring back being able to take screenshots it'd make my life so much easier :(""\"There was an error with the network.  Please try again.\"  I have tried again over 30 times.  I can't use the app because I can't create an account.   The device, a Samsung Galaxy S5, is clearly listed on the compatibility list.   I followed their instructions to uninstall and re-install with no change.   I have tried 4G and wifi networks with no change.   So far, AliveCor has not solved the problem so I tried lying: I told the app I forgot my password (I didn't have a password yet.) and I was sent to the reset page and I was in, finally.  I recorded my first ecg.  As a physician, this process is too complicated for the majority of my patients therefore I cannot recommend Kardia to everyone but only to intelligent motivated patients.""I think Kardia is a fantastic idea and worthy of five stars but I have given two because of short comings. The cavalier attitude to customer support and lack of compatability with S Health lets Kardia down.   I presume that the Android apk was an after thought and probably a poor relation to the IOS app. That is why I am demoting my 5 star rating to a 3 star rating. If you want 5 stars integrate with S Health. S Health has superior BP recording to Kardia and I only want to enter my BP data once. Quite apart from that S Health appears to be the more medically orientated apk when compared to Google Fit.  Demoted from 3 star to 2 star because 6 weeks to reply to complaints on user reviews is too long and is a sign of poor customer service. Improve your response times to regain my esteem and the star you lost.""I like that I can see what my heart is doing but, my issues is PACs and tachycardia both of which are basically ignored. Also, I take a lot of readings and to send/download them all individually is a pain! Maybe add the capability to access your app from multiple devices - I take readings with my phone but want the data on my home computer.""I emailed Alivecor, but heard nothing back after their autoresponse. I know the device still works as i can see it trying to come through on my wife's phone which uses the old app. I even tried a factory reboot on my phone (Droid Maxx. 4.4.4). No luck. Can we get the old app back please?""App seems good but most of my readings it won't comment on because they are below 50bpm. Im an endurance runner so have slow h/r  but suffer with SVT and recently had 2nd degree heart block. Don't think this gadgt will be much use if it doesn't recognise my normal heart rate :(""Kardia mobile""I received the Kardia mobile without the attachment piece. I have not found a phone number where I can speak to someone on any piece of documentation that was sent with the product. Super inconvenient and I haven't even used the product""...but can't yet. Not a Dr, just a lay man who was just diagnosed w 1st-time AFIB. This app seem to be a good way to check if my AFib is off/on or persistent. For 2 months persistent. After my initial reading w/Kardia I got a reply within an hour from a cardiologist who indicated \"Atrial Fibrillation,\" \"Needs Review,\" and \"Forward to your physician within 24 hours.\" I already knew I had AFib so this did not shock me. Since then I've done about 25 readings. About 4 simply said \"Unclassified.\" All the rest said \"Possible AF\". My question is whether these are the only two descriptors possible (Unclassified and Possible AF)? OR are there other results/ descriptors that indicate DEFINITE AF without the word \"Possible\"? Next question is there an online manual or list of potential descriptors? If the two  mentioned are the ONLY ones, even that would be helpful to know. I'm a little puzzled why the initial Dr analysis came back definitely AFIB and all subsequent readings are \"Possible AFIB.\" That gives me perhaps a false hope, that Afib was not detected. Update: Good news. I found out there is a manual, but you have to hunt for it on website. It should have a link on quikstart guide IMHO.""I have AF if my heart is going to fast I can see and take more medicine and send my doctor the results .If I am worried it gives me confidence that all is well I now don't keep going back to hospital thank you""Really expected this to be a \"plug and play\" --compatibility checked as compatible with my phone. Installed and got the dreaded \"screen overlay\" issue---went to net and tried all of the possible fixes and non worked. Call support and young lady said she had never heard of the problem and when I began to describe and issue and tried solutions she said she didn't know what I was talking about since she didn't have a Android device. Am sending unit back---real shame wanted the product and tried to use it---now phone has the overlay issue on almost all my apps after installing the Alivecor App.""Never would do the initial reading. Advertised compatible for Android but when I went in to check further I didn't find  Model: AC-009 listed.  Very disappointed.   Update: Also when I first installed and opened app it said Welcome back Jason.???""Older app was easy. Open the app touch the pads. Boom... recording. Now it is a multistep process. Sometimes it wont even read my pads. I have two. Both are AC-009. Yes, new cr2016 batts for both. On top of that I can no longer see the technicians or doctors on the page to do advanced analysis. I talked to kardia and they said that the app takes time to update. Well it has been 3 weeks since the update and nada. I wish it were possible to roll back to the app that I had not this partially functioning app.""After a recent update, I can no longer access any ECGs except the most recently recorded. Apparently you now have to buy a premium membership to access your older data - seriously?  Bait and switch!  Older version was simpler to use also. Wish I could roll back the update!""Latest update is cumbersome and it takes more steps to use. It used to automatically start recording, now you have to tell it to start. It also used to go directly to notes, it doesn't any more. Note length and tag qty is still limited, issue if you want them to show up on a PDF report. They also need to add additional capability to the reports like adding reports/insights longer than 1 week. One month be good, but date range would be best. PDF is not working on my phone -only way to get it is to email.""It takes too long for the reading to begin now, 30 seconds minimum - restarting the app and trying again most of the time.  U need it to record immediately if I am symptomatic. There are too many unnecessary features now and that slows down the recording. After paying quite a bit for the device I really would like it to work.""Impressed with both the device and the app. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S5 and have had no software issues at all. Works on my Nexus 7 too. It's obviously not as good as a multiple electrodes on chest ECG but it's as good as you'll get for doing what it does. The app fires up in seconds and is super sensitive to the device. As soon as you put your fingers on those pads there is a response from the app. Used the diagnosis service and recieved the report within 20 minutes!""I have had this for a year now and after each ecg it will say \"ecg normal\" but now it just keeps saying \"tags are loading please wait or check back later \" it's not telling me if reading is normal or not.. or letting me tag symptoms.""I like the AliveCor device and I regularly used the previous version of this app, but this upgrade is bewildering in its desire for more access to my personal information.  It seems to assume by default that I want my voice recorded while it takes my ECG reading, which is not the case at all.  (While I understand how voice annotations might be useful for research, I do not want to participate, and I really dislike that this kind of very sensitive feature is \"opt out\" rather than \"opt in\".)  Similarly the app wants my geo location without telling me what it's going to do with that information or how it's even related to the task at hand.  It then asks for permission to use \"vital signs sensors\" on my phone without explaining what that means or why the ECG device itself is not sufficient for that.   Separately from that, I was eager to integrate with my Google Fit account, but it grays out the screen and freezes when I try to set that up.    At least the old functionality still works now that I'm past the gauntlet of data requests, so I'm still happy enough with this app.""Terrible App. Worked once on my HTC M8s and now will not record anything. I got the alivecor to help diagnose a heart condition but instead the stress of trying to get it to work will give me a heart attack. Waste of \u20ac130 and I will be looking for a refund.""When i first tried this, I was very impressed. Of course my initial reading was normal. However, I spoke too soon.  By the time you open the app, apply your finger pads to the metal device behind the phone, it can take over a whole minute to capture your cardiac rhythm. It has not captured an abnormal run yet. I emailed the app company about this and never heard back. My fingers are clean, no lotion and I keep the metal clean, app always up to date. March 3 '16 new Huawei, app still doesn't work at all.""Since the upgrade there is no longer the BFx. I really appreciate that too. How do I get it back in my settings to turn it on and use it agsin. It just up and dissappear ed""Won't do anything.. Works on my daughter's iPad. But my Droid Turbo 2 it does absolutely nothing. I've email customer service an haven't received a reply.""Unlike some reviewers claim,  you can see your own ecg and share it with your own doctor by email.""AVOID doing business with this company!  Get the app & purchase the EKG device, BUT the company will not let you see your own tracing without sending it to a cardiologist  PLUS the company will not respond email questions about the charges you can expect.""The first time you use it it won't show you anything until the strip is sent to a cardiologist for a reading. This is free and a part of the fda requirements.  Then it is unlocked and you can use it freely. Detects a-fib automatically but you can tell more if you can read ecgs or pay a nominal fee to send it for a professional reading.  Works great and support has responded to any questions I've had within 1 business day.""Doesn't work at all, no customer service response.  Sending it back after waiting years to get one.""Requires account creation to use.  Readings are stored in the cloud. After 1st reading (lengthy turn-a-round ), all readings are instantly recorded and available from any app supported phone/tablet. Hold device very close to phone microphone for best results.""Does not work with Htc One M9 . When they say it works with most Android phones you think it would work with HTC's flagship phone. Dont do what i did and just assume check their site. If your specific phone and model is not on the list be prepared , you might just be the pround new owner of a $80 skid plate for the back of your phone.""It only took a few hours for the results of the first ecg to come back. I made the mistake of checking the high cholesterol without knowing and recording the details. After I unchecked the cholesterol box the app started working. Works great with my Samsung Note 4.""App is good after a quick fix... Read on. After sending in the initial ECG for review, you must wait. You will get an email at the address that's associated with the account, stating that the review is complete, but the app will still say that the ECG is under review when you open it. Log in to the website from the link in the email and view the report and then go back to the app, tap on the right upper corner and then logout. Log into the app again and everything will be working. Hope this helps others.""The second edition of the monitor gave me a better reading than the third edition,  which is (probably) more sensitive or has a worse filter. The trace is barely readable with the latest one. Which is a shame because it is a more appealing devise.""I agreed to the Terms of Service, the next screen required an Email address and password which I entered. Instructions are to place hands on \"Metal Plates\" . WHAT METAL PLATES?  metal Plates do not exist on my Samsung. and  it would not read my ECG. Could not use the Freaking app; removed it !  FU AliveECG!! Just went to the company website d to have my registration removed and MORE personal information was required just to email.""Tells me i can find my ecg in history. But there is no history button. Very poor tutorial. Shows lots of screens in video none of which are available on mine. May be because there is a 24hr button, but i already was emailed my first result. Poor. Found the manual not really helpful. Mine app locked up too after first test, mote than 24 hrs later. Should give action to take on the screen.""Didn't tell me how to use it, what I needed to use it. Cheap way to get personal details. So I need to buy something to go on the back of my phone??? I wouldn't know because I'm not a mind reader.""Really helpful in thinking about monitoring ECG in double quick time. Can export ECG as PDF via email or Bluetooth. Perhaps needs api to tf directly to EHR or similar. Congrats Dr Dave and team.""    ""com.lowestmed.android"":     ""Only need app I use! I have tried so many other apps and websites for discounts, I can't even count; this one is by far the LOWEST PRICE. Discount cards are BS, the price shown on this app is what you pay.""I am still amazed at how well these Pharmacy cards work.  This one is typically accepted at more Drug Stores and their price on my medication was $37 while a similar type of app had the best price at $97 for the same exact medicine.  And both showed how much priced can vary from on pharmacy to the next.  I am using Hyvee a few miles away over Walgreens who wanted $203.00 for the exact same Rx.  This is by far the best!!  They have been spot on on the prices being charged too.  No sudden increase in cost when you show up.""The prices are all wrong! It said it would be $88 at Smith's. I go in and they said they accept the lowest med card and yet it is now $280 dollars. Worthless app/card.""Really does work! Pharmacy tech didn't believe it was going to work, once he entered the appropriate codes! Bam it worked lower price then express Scripts!""Went to the doctor and was very hopeful to get the help I needed to get my life back together, only to be crushed to see that the medication cost was 91$. Being uninsured with a low income job, there was no way I could afford that. Found this app and was able to get my medicine for just 10$! Thank you!""I found it very easy to use and liked the minions hard work. I thought it was so cute when it said please hold, Our Minions are loading the information. It made me laugh and smile and therefore got my vote. Humor is everything. If you are taken meds, you are most likely not doing well and to be able to make someone smile who is not doing well is huge.  I love the cense of humor.""Very good savings for some and some are not so good savings.  It is like every other one of the prescription benefit savings cards out there. I do appreciate services like this very much.""This app Rock's! This is much better then goodrx. I have been using this app for about 6months and I have never had one problem. I tell all my family and friends about this app and and after they try it for them selves, they call me and thank me telling me they saved so much money by using this app. I continue to tell people every week at my doctors office about this app and they always come back the next week and thank me. And they tell all their friends and families about this awesome app. I think Lowestmeds should offer me a job to tell everybody about how great they are. I know a lot of people and I can use people's emails to spread the word and tell everybody that this app is a must have especially if u are paying out of pocket for their prescriptions. Thank you Lowestmeds for having the lowest prices and a great web site that is so easy to use. You all are the best!!""It's a straightforward app, with no intrusion to your phone data. If medicine database is lost just reinstall.""A little slow but cheap prices""Good, quick information.""This company is lying about the amount of discounts.  Took price and coupon to listed pharmacy.  Wasn't days but hours between getting coupon and picking up medicine and price was going to be more than twice than app said.  Not pharmacy but lowestmed as pharmacy called.  update: called lowestmed and said price I got was for 30 pills which is not what app said.  They gave me a price that was within $1 of goodrx so since the pills are ready I will go with that.  I gave an extra star for respond in ng back but I'll use goodrx from now on.""Am please w/the app...Is simple and straightforward. Simple to save coupon codes, aswell saved more money than the in-store's own discount by a bit.""I love this discount card. Best one I've ever used""This is by far the best discount card! I have used many others and this is the best around! Stop looking and just download!! Thanks again lowest meds! Youve saved my family a ton of momey!!!""Consistently better prices than my insurance.

Easy to use.""Could not login after few days. Was able to login from laptop, so it wasn't me typing wrong password. Tried reinstalling App twice. It worked, but only for some time. Customer service kept saying \"Update the App\". Not helpful""When the app works it is good. Logged in, had it save the username, log out, try to go back in, receive error messages about wrong password or \"please enter password\" even though a password is entered. Can't use it if I can't log in. Website is the way to go.""Worked the first time I used it, and now it completely freezes my phone, the second I try to open it. Sensitive information should not be this wonky.""Badly behaved. I frequently had to reboot my phone when trying to log in from an email, as the app failed to load and the screen froze. Also requires formal sign-out in order to return to phone.""Won't authenticate user id and password after signing in from the app the first time. Only work around is to reinstall every time you want to use it. I'll keep using the website until the kinks are worked out.   MyChart works much better.""Don't USE APP! Unless you want to keep resetting your F'g Password EVERYTIME you log in! It NEVER lets you log in without Changing your password!! Sucks!""Freezes my phone, but great concept. I shouldn't have to restart my phone tho to use it. And more importantly since this is sensitive information there really should be a logout option. I can't find it OK update here. I had to uninstall the app because when opening up links from email my phone went blank as it couldn't connect to either app or website to open up messages""*EDIT* From 5 stars to 1 star. I tried to work around the problem I referred to below by using the website on my phone's browser to see the history of specific tests. But now that I have the app I can't use the website. Signing in on the browser always opens the app, even though I don't have that set as a default. Also, I hate that I am not allowed to take screenshots. That eliminates the other workaround I tried for comparing current results to previous ones. I'm really sad to uninstall this app but I have to have easy access to my historical results. \ud83d\ude41 *********** This app is wonderful! I use Patient Gateway frequently and almost exclusively on mobile. The app is beautifully simple and easy to navigate. It's a big improvement over trying to use the website on mobile. THANK YOU, PARTNERS, for making this app! Makes my life much easier! My only request is that you give us a way to see a current lab result on the same screen as the previous ones. It's not easy to see how a specific test result has changed over time. If I want to see how my current renal panel compares to last month's I need to scroll down through the more recent results to find the previous renal panel. And if I want to go back a year? That's a lot of scrolling. On the whole though, this app is fast and easy to use.""    ""com.fourthcareer.medlist.free"":     ""Just want list of my meds.  Works great didn't ask for my email.

Asks for email name for list, but will not let you enter an email address.  Doesn't transfer input from free version, you have to input list again. Don't waste your money.""This app is wonderful.  Will purchase the paid version.  Entering my meds was easy, and emailing them is a brilliant idea.  Kudos!  My docs and their staffs were gobsmacked \ud83d\ude01""Wow! I have a lot of medications... and a lot of doctors. My various  doctors are ALWAYS asking for just  current list of meds, and I'm ALWAYS telling them it has not changed since LAST time.

Heh, heh, heh! That will teach them! Thanks for empowering me!!!  (Could we have a spot to put the doctors name and number for each med?

It's only a one-time fee, after all.))""I would like to have a way to add a family member's meds also....and was unclear on how to close the app for security purposes.  Love that I can have a list of my meds with me at all times though.""It is exactly as advertised, a very simple way to maintain and effeciently\u200b communicate your medications to your provider.  This was just what I was looking for.  Also, I emailed the developer with a question and received a very quick response.  Impressed!""It's fantastic,  easy to use when I go to a doctor in bring up the app or download the information to the doctor,  it's fast and easy.  I taught my boss and one of my coworkers  how to use it in case of a emergency  (I'm over 65)""I don't know what doctors you go to, but all the docs I go to laughed at the idea of me emailing my meds or any other medical info since it's a privacy violation, even if the patient agrees to it. Along with email servers being hacked on a daily basis, this app emailing private info is not only stupid but dangerous. Take pics of your meds labels, create a photo album on your phone called meds or whatever you like, and save the pics there, adding new meds to the same album. It's not brain surgery.""I gave this five stars because it's exactly what I was looking for.  It's a clean ad-free app that makes it easier to keep track of my meds.  I create my profile, easily add my medical conditions, insurance information and my meds.  This is the best app of its kind.  I really enjoy the simple usable interface--no bloatware, just simple and easy.  I highly recommend this app to anyone looking to record their information without any BS.  Great job, developers!""I entered all my medication information, then after a day or two, everything disappeared.  The second time it happened, after I re-entered everything, I had the presence of mind to email it to myself.   The information has disappeared AGAIN now,  for a THIRD time.  This is ridiculous.  If your app does this on a regular basis, you need to either fix it or take it out of Google Play, because it sucks as it is.""Such an easy-to-use app for keeping track of my mother's medications. Now, I can just email them to her doctors. Thank you!""I found I can so the same thing on my phone.  I use my memo pad, create a new account called medications list. Then open it and add a new item, being the title as the 1st persons list, then in description /note I put the list of meds, strength, directions and so on. When I want to share (email) I just tap the 3 dots at the right top of screen and send as an email or send to my printer. Easy without any additional prying eyes.""

This app is so ridiculous that it won't even let you use a card to pay unless your Bill is outstanding.

Why can't we just input the date !?""I can't find the option for the debit card.""The app was fixed, repairing the sync function, but now it stops counting steps after about 11 pm, despite what Google Fit records.   Due to my busy schedule I go to the gym late and this is as bad as when it didn't sync at all.""The app is back to shortchanging us on steps. It worked fine at first when it synced directly with your tracker. Then they added the extra step of syncing with Google Fit (a useless app that doesn't record or sync accurately) and for months I had to send screenshots of my tracker data to get the credit. They finally fixed it and all was good. Now we are back to the shortchanging and the cumbersome, time consuming process of sending daily screenshots. Please fix and streamline this process! $20/month is significant!!!""I replaced my phone with a LG Fortune smartphone. It still slow for the app to apply.""Can't sync with google health. When it is synced wrong data is synced""When you click \"forgot password\" because of course you're not going to remember it, it just reloads the login screen. Come. On.""App won't open! Must be a sign \"Going out of business\"""I cannot go any further with anything until the first of march which i absolutely dislike.  I cannot say much about this app yet due to that but I'll be back with my opinion""UPDATE: If you are cought in the verify email loop it is because you cannot verify your account via email on a cell phone.  This is a bug and you must verify your account from a desktop computer. After that you can download the app and use it on your cell.""So far I can't get past the verify email loop. Such a disgrace.  Update: 1 star -5!!! I think there was a verifications process that took about a day to synchronize. So far the app is great and I downloaded Google fit to accompany it. With Google fit you track your steps then step 2000+ and you earn a dollar for the day. I am enjoying the impeccable rocord this app will be keeping; example is the Dr. Notes, prescriptions and lab results. Great app if you have this insurance.""Registration is broken at the email confirmation step.""doesn't work...go back to misfit...it was flawless!""Cant login,  keeps sending to same email page over and over and cant register""Poor poor poor!!!!! Cant even verify email""Can't register it keeps sending me to verify my email. Fix this oscar!!""I used to consider this a great app. It's still OK for calling a doctor, but the primary utility as an app came from tracking my steps. With Oscar insurance, lost steps is lost cash, as step goals literally give you money back. This thing won't grab my steps off of Google Fit accurately, and the old functionality to grab steps directly off my tracker via Bluetooth has been removed. Either fix the app's utility or fix the insurance plan, cause these errors stand to cost me $20 per month.  Edit: It turns out Oscar and Misfit dissolved their former partnership, and that's why your old tracker is useless now. Oscar's app doesn't sync properly to Google Fit either, but at least with Google fit you can manually add steps if the actual recorded steps don't import.""The app mostly works fine for me. However, whenever I try to set up a call on the app with a doctor the app locks up, then crashes taking me back to the first screen when you first click on the Call a Doctor button on the home screen.  Samsung Galaxy S7, Running Marshmallow""This is a fine app for Oscar Insurance needs, but you totally ruined the Steps program. Google Fit does not support the Misfit trackers Oscar gave us and only records steps from our phones now. IT dept has effectively discontinued the Steps program with this update. I make a living writing software and I would get fired for a fiasco like this. Admit the error and roll back to the previous version that most of us were happy with.""Every time I try to sign in, a screen pops up asking me to verify my email. So I go to my email and click the verify link and the app opens again asking me to sign in. So I sign in and then I get the same message that a verification email has been sent to me. I can't verify because it is stuck in an endless loop. I've tried restarting and re-installing. I've attempted to verify my email nearly 15 times over several days.""Each time i try and enter my password, i receive a message telling me my app is old and i need to download the new version from the app store. What new version? I haven't seen a new version.""The steps interface has been broken multiple times for 3 months of the last 9. Something in the app (NOT a Misfit problem; I tested!) causes tens of megabytes of unnecessary data usage and multi-minute delays every time it tries to access the steps database, then throws an error. Advice to testers: Use the latest version of Android Studio and SDK Tools. Emulate this app on a Motorola Nexus 6 with Android 6.0.1 and you'll see what I mean. Please test for 7.0 to prevent these problems in the future! Thanks.""***update Thank you, Oscar. The problem was fixed within a week. So happy to have my misfit and Oscar aps communicating again. :) I would like to be able to view insurance cards of all my family on the app. Other than that, I love it. ***  The most recent update rendered the ap all but useless. :( I  was syncing my Misfit app to Oscar, but now they no longer sync. :( My steps will only count for Oscar IF I only sync the misfit to Oscar and not the Misfit app. Not a happy camper. Please fix this problem.""It asks for your date of birth and then shows an actual 2016 calendar,  with no option of changing the year other  than clicking back all the way down to your year of birth, and then crashes! Worthless  just like Obamacare.""How am I supposed to know when I receive a response to a message inquiry?  Email is insufficient for a good user experience.""As of this week both my wife and my Misfit app and account aren't syncing with the Oscar app. Both apps are up to date. Please fix!""This app was terrific. Until you updated it yesterday. Now it does not work at all. Can't keep track of my steps, or access my ID card. Totally useless. Please fix.""IT Security Data Management""I do enjoy having Oscar as a health insurance. As a freelancer it is my favorite so far. The app however has some little quirks that bother me. I often have to put my pin number in twice in a row to view my steps. The other things that I wish the app had was more detail about my steps throughout the day. Misfit warned me not to use both the Oscar and Misfit apps because it could erase data. Wish I could just see when my activity was heaviest, etc.""I received my misfit yesterday. Installed apps linked to Oscar and walked for over 1 hour and 45 minutes. Guess what no steps no points nothing. Tried to link the accounts like it says apparently I'm not smart enough to figure it out. I'm not liking this one bit.""The version before this one was much better. I really liked being able to track my progress. The syncing issue was fixed and the pin made to easier to sign in. This version won't let me sign in at all, says I have to wait till my plan starts. Very concerning that I won't be covered, even though I am paid up to date in my coverage. I checked online and can sign in there, account seems to be okay and I contacted customer service to make sure. I'll update the review once the bug is fixed.""If you forget to sync it, no worries now... It saves the information from previous days! Fantastic!""Attempting to log in briefly takes you to the app screen with \"Steps\" and the other icons, but then it immediately dumps out to the login screen again.  Un-installing and re-installing doesn't fix it.  (It's also not a password problem, because typing an incorrect pw brings up the \"wrong credentials\" dialog.)  This seems to have started right around the time they updated the app with the new PIN fast-login feature.  I tried contacting Oscar via the website several days ago, but no response.  Even when it was working, I found the bluetooth connection to be flaky as hell.  Also, the way the \"daily steps goal\" ramps up immediately to 10,000 and stays there makes it pretty difficult to achieve.  I've gone to the gym for an hour or more with the misfit on, and still not hit that goal.""Update broke syncing. I can't link my misfit anymore and I lost several days of heavy activity. Why does this app even track steps? It should be misfit tracking my steps and Oscar should be an app inside the misfit app like every other company. That way I can track my sleep too. Yes it's \"free\" but why force us to use this in a completely broken way? I actually want my step and sleep data but I can't get it. I'm not going to buy another tracker to do that and carry two devices on me.""I'm a new Oscar subscriber, and am happy to have a way to get credit for exercise.  I will admit I was not expecting to see a big change in my habits, I practice yoga regularly and bike when there isn't snow on the roads, so I feel pretty active.  However, at times I work from home, and I will say the motivation of hitting my goal, has gotten me up and out to walk a lot more than I would have on my own.  Especially in the middle of the day, when it's 10 degrees outside.  So thank you for providing a nudge towards staying active!  As for the app, I've only really found it useful as a step counter. It was driving me crazy having to enter my password many times throughout the day, so the pin login has been a BIG improvement.

I get it you need to correct a low but since it repeats often even if you're in the process of correcting your your sugar and go back to a meeting or movie it is beeping, super annoying and unprofessional. Type ones already have pumps needles to set them apart we don't need annoying noises to make us even more different......""Thanks tech support for getting me back up and running!!""I am pleased with the convienence this app gives me when compared to carrying the separate receiver. I upgraded directly from a g4 platinum and this app does everything that did, plus the event tracking. BG is always on my lock screen and I can get to all history data easily. I use vibrate only for high and low warnings and it will only vibrate in those zones, matching the receivers operation. Critical low is adequately loud, but actually quieter than the G4 reciever. Overall, I love only carrying 1 device and having my receiver be more resiliant than IP22 rating.""The screeching high and low alerts makes this app unusable in a business setting or any other situation where a blaring noise will be a disruption. Which is everywhere. If in a call the alarm will deafen you.""Needs android mobile support, like only hear watch if available. Also needs ability to change notifications mute time, ability to mute ultra low, and the ability to add or remove sounds for ultra low.

I would like to control the volume of the alerts, add values to the insulin and carb events, and duration to the exercise events. It would be really cool if it would also get Fitbit data and automatically flag exercise times and duration. Otherwise I'm really happy with it so far.""I absolutely love it. The only thing that bothers me is I don't know how to go back and look at the trend graph from earlier in the day""Wish I could control volume and reminder time frames for lows.

Thanks for the great sensor, now just focus on the GUI software for a bit!""i installed this app literally the first day it was announced.  I have been looking forward to leaving my receiver at home and just bringing my phone to handle all my CGM needs.  I want to love this app so much.  I love the interface, I didn't have any connectivity issues, it gives me exactly the information I need in an extremely accurate and usable way.  I uninstalled the app within 12 hours.  Here's why.  There is no way to control the alert volume, at all.  The app overrides your media volume, sets it to the absolute max and blares the alarm, regardless of any other activities that are going on.  I was literally holding my phone up to my ear on a business call when the alarm sounded for a high blood sugar (which I had already corrected for) it was deafening.  I was fortunate that I was on a call with someone who knew I was T1D and was understanding enough that I needed a minute to let the ringing in my ear stop.  My wife almost smothered me the first night because of the alarm almost waking up our kids (who NEED their sleep).  I uninstalled the app at 2am in order to preserve my marriage and possibly my safety.  I hope beyond hope that Dexcom continues to work on this.""The app worked for tracking my sugar levels. My problem was with the volume and timing of the low alerts. There is no way to adjust the volume and it is way too loud. No way to change it to vibrate either. It only silences for 5 minutes before it starts again. My sugar takes longer than that to come back up and in the middle of the night losing up to an hour of sleep to babysit the app is a deal killer. I uninstalled the app and am just using the receiver again.""If it allowed me to adjust the volume of the mandatory alarms... I'd rate higher... But my Samsung s7 at full volume in the middle of business meetings! AAAAAH! And this is of course after I've already treated for the low (because the device continues to register a low long after the low has been addressed) Bad decision on the part of the developers! Makes it difficult to even keep my phone with me sometimes.""Loses signal, cant find the transmitter, and the few rkmes it does work, you have to force stop to make it be quiet. I want my G4 back. This G5 stuff sucks.""The app worked great when i first used downloaded it a few months ago on my galaxy note 5.  Earlier this week, i suddenly.lost signal which expected it to reconnect. After 12 hours of no signal, i trouble shooted potential issues, called dexcom , but to no avail. For some reason it cant pair with the g5 transmitter anymore. Tech's if you read these reviews id recommend looking into why.  Trouble shooting ive done to date is.  Reinstalled, changed sensors,  changed transmitters. Yet it still does not pair with the transmitter.. oh well looks.like its back to using the dexcom receiver instead..""It's awesome... other than it draining my battery! I can change all of the settings, except for Urgent Lows, to vibrate. Because it sounds like an emergency broadcast if the sound is on! And I still don't know how to transfer the data from my phone, to my Dexcom Clarity acct... so technically, I've still been using my receiver, for the data. And any help with this would be quite useful! :D""It works well enough, but needs a couple very large quality of life improvements.  Firstly, if there's a weekly history like the transmitter, I can't find it, and it is VERY helpful to have that.   Secondly, the calibration alert. This needs to be changed to NEVER drop down on the screen, or at least have that as an option in the app. It constantly interferes with what I'm doing on my phone to the point where I've been forced to disable alerts from the android system settings, which also blocks sound alerts. Disabling sound alerts of course disables the important ones from the app. I don't always have the opportunity to calibrate it (especially as it is almost always accurate after day 1 anyway) and hours of dealing with that stupid drop down endlessly are absolutely infuriating.   These two changes would make it go from 2 stars to 5 for me, but as it is I'm probably just going to go back to the transmitter, even though I hate carrying another thing around on me.  Update: The utter lack of control for alarms and alerts is a serious issue. Even if you have one of the minor alerts set to never repeat, it will repeat every 5 minutes until the issue is solved. If you have a moderate (normal) high, that can take an hour or two to balance back out, all the while the alarm is gojng off every 5 minutes unless you set it to some even higher number. Encouraging the user to set their triggers to more extreme numbers is absolutely inexcusable and they should absolutely fix this immediately.""OK first attempt, but needs significant improvement. I see repeated references to the signal loss problem from users--I have this too--along with hacked solutions including turning the notification off. My solution for this has been to just unpair the Dexcom from bluetooth then re-pair, then it tends to re-establish connection. But YOU SHOULD AUTOMATE THIS FOR USERS! Don't make us hack solutions together. Then, I need more control over the alerts. In the daytime, I know my blood sugar is low after 1 obnoxiously loud alert, but it takes 15-30 minutes for my blood sugar to come back up, so please STOP alerting me again and again and again--if I'm in a business meeting, this is massively distracting and I find myself having to explain to people what's happening. Related, ever since I've installed this app, it seems to be messing with the notifications and sounds across my entire device--sometimes silent, sometimes blaring, regardless of my settings. There must be more transparency about how alerts work with phone settings and how I can control those.""Works ok on my GS7, too bad I can't upgrade to the 8 or else I can't use this app. Dexcom please support more devices. Also, it would be nice if the process of sharing glucose data with my doctor was better explained. They used to hook my receiver up to a computer in their office, but I don't think they can do the same with my phone.""I was really hoping this would work on my android phone, but am disappointed. Unless my son is right next to me, I get a lost signal on my phone. I had hoped the phone app would be better than the G5 receiver, but they both are subpar in keeping signal. I prefer the G4 and wish we could go back. We almost never lost signal with G4, and are surprised when we have a signal with this G5.""Easy to install. Be sure you have the transmitter barcode label ready as you need to take photo to connect. Also you have to log into your account when prompted so have that info. Install, log in and take photo and you are done. Took 5 minutes.""It's pretty basic and not many settings options (no volume change) but for me, the worst part is the \"security settings\" that prevent me from taking a screenshot of my graph are REALLY ticking me off. Let me take a damn screenshot of my own info, thanks.""I have been waiting for the Android app and I was so excited to get it all set up but I cannot help but to be a little disappointed. First and foremost, the signal is lost more than its not on my Galaxy S6 so I am not getting to see my blood sugars. I have tried disconnecting and reconnecting, stopping and starting the sensor but nothing seems to help! Also, the low and high alerts are obnoxious, I don't understand why vibrate is not an option. I don't like having to explain to my coworkers every time my blood sugar drops or increases!

It shows your number right there, and I loved that. My only problem was that I trust the receiver more. I had to delete the app, it was too much on my phone.

That did the trick. Thanks, Kinosis. I was expecting this simulation to be different. You do not control movement of the doctor and there are no controls like a gamepad would have. It's more like a study for a test. But it's a FUN test! You are given scenarios in which you pick A B C or D answers. After picking your answers you watch the hands do the movements. Everything is 3D looking. If you pick the wrong answer, it lowers your score. Also, everything to my knowledge looks medically correct.

I find it a fantastic tool, the logbook is an \"at a glance\" blessing, plus being adle to insert time and food eaten in the notes section. The graph page is also very helpful when visiting the diabetic nurse, in fact we wouldn't be without it now. Well done Diabetes. M""To say this app helps me manage my diabetes is a major understatement! I'd be completely lost without it now. I started-off only using it for basic functions such as logging my blood sugar. Now I've dived deeper into what it offers i find I'm taking the guess work out of how much glucose to take to treat a hypo or how much bolus is required to bring BG levels back down to target. Seriously considering subscribing to paid version. 5 stars guys!""Best app! I use it with nightscout - send automatically data to diabetes m &lt;3""Very easy to use, alot of information can be stored for doctor's appointment.""Back to 5 starts (now that the ads bug is patched) keep going on developing this great apps!!""It would be great if you could use the fool database for FatSecret, as it has food entries specific to various countries. It would also be great if the app could access the food data from Google Fit, as you can use other apps to write data to it.  Also could you guys look into adding calories burned with exercise please. Including the calories burned from apps such as Google Fit  Then the app would get 5 stars.   PS I am a paying subscriber""Update 2018: I have a subscription and I try to export the report, and the export crashes for any format. Really getting worse.   Initial 2016: I am trying to import a CSV file exported from my Accu-check mobile and keep getting a date format error, even thought it\u2019s the right format, the processing also includes time which is a different column.  Cannot see how I could import my old data, would have been good to try and use it.  @Rossen: Thanks for the response, but for a fact I know that there is at-least 1 other app on the Play Store and iOS which took the csv file and processed that data. And also I had a look, no where does it say in the csv file. If you need I can send you a copy of the CSV file.""This is the best diabetes app I've ever used. I really can't say enough about it. It does a good job of calculating your bolus, but also backing out active insulin, or if you are on the low side recommending carbs. It provides several food databases and good reports.""Has made our life so much easier! The school nurse, my hubby & I can access our daughter's account so we can all record in it. This is with the paid version but I highly recommend it. From the app we can send reports to her Endo. There are some things I haven't figured out with it but with time, I hope to. Great app!!!!""Easy  to use as well as print reports from the data we type in..""DON'T PAY ANYTHING FOR THIS APP, I GOT RIPPED OFF READ THE FULL STORY BELOW INCLUDING THE DEVELOPER RESPONSE. I'm a type 1 diabetic and this app in it's ORIGINAL FORMAT has helped me get my blood sugar levels controlled much better than they where before I used this. I've downgraded this to 3 stars because after purchasing this app I now have further opportuny to pay for a subscription for premium features, no way in hell am I giving any more money. The premium features should already be unlocked for people who have paid for the app and the subscription offered to new users. Bad move developers.   Now for the next cock up after the latest update, my data no longer syncs multiple devices via Google drive, I think I'll lose another star with this app until this is sorted.  Developer response: Hello! The paid license was only for removing Ads and this is still valid. Subscription is needed to cover the expenses for the whole team to work and expand the Android, iOS and Web apps and also to support the cloud services. Unfortunately this cannot be achieved with one time payment.  I paid for the app and part of that payment was some additional features, one of which was sync across multiple devices via Google drive which was working perfectly up to the 20th April 2017. Now you have removed that feature. If that one time payment was for advert removal only, I would not have paid. Now I feel ripped off. I won't be recommending this app to anyone. Looking for a new app, total scam. ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE!  Developer response: It was clearly stated that it was Ads Removal license only and we are sorry that you understood it the other way. We clearly explained why we need the subscription and we will continue developing new free and paid features, for the user who believe we do a good job and helping the diabetics. We don't see this as a scam  There was no subscription service when I paid for the app and all functions as I described was working up until 20th April 2017. So not only are you ripping customers off you are lying to us as well. So what we have is an app that now doesn't do what I originally paid for but we also have poor customer service too. EDIT: in response to their last comment, it's a scam when we have functions, and you take them away. Sync across Google drive worked perfectly with all my android devices, this function ceased to work on the 20 April 2017 after this app updated at that time. And all of a sudden subscription service is introduced. For all diabetics who are looking for a good fully functioning app that is completely free and ad free sites everything this one does without paying for anything then try DIABETES STUDIO you won't regret it.""Being diabetic is hard. This app makes life much easier for me and my diabetic team. I used the free version for years but opted to go premium last month. Just the customisable items in the food data base are worth the small monthly fee!""I love the detail of the data collected and the food database.

The app also offers helpful suggestions to keep your  glucose management on track.""Like the app, could use a few things such as a way to force it to update the data that was most recently inputted and the ability to use different formulas for insulin to blood sugar ratios would be great""The app was great. I have not been able to use the app since Friday the 8th. It keeps crashing and  app  will not open. I uninstalled and reinstalled but the app will not open. I sent feedback by email but I haven't received any reply.  I was using the premium program but I will not renew until the app is fixed.""Two weeks into using this app and I'm very happy I found it.  It's packed with features, stable, and data entry is intuitive.  I've yet to need the manual.  Great program to help manage diabetes.""I don't use all of the features yet....but, it keeps me informed And motivated to try!  Is there anything else?""It helps me keep track, and provide me interesting information.""This app has given me so much data  When I began to have difficulty regulating my BS, the data in this app helped my Dr get me back on track. I'm so grateful it was available.""I had originally given this program 4 out of 5 it is lucky to get a 2 now.  I updated on my Samsung tab and the program crashed would not open.  Deleted and re installed and now it will not let me restore my data.  You had a wonderful app that helped out tremendously now you have garbage, as i back my data between tablet and phone and it won't do that anymore""Registered but could not get in.  Tried to correct.  Said wrong user name, wrong email.  Finally just removed it.""Just started using this app recently. Seems to have a lot of information and tracking options with an easy to use interface. So far so good""30 days since diagnosis and wanted something besides notebook to track information. I liked the ease of use and my doctor loved the information it showed him on my first follow up. Lacking fifth star only for the ads and I haven't paid for an app since I went to a smart phone.""It used to be a really good app but now it freezes up all the time when I do searches for food constantly it just locks up and you lose any information if you close it out . I have sent reports in to them and you get no response whatsoever. so I'm guessing that they just don't care if it works or not .""Great app for logging all results plus other important data needed documented! Being able to print out a log is my favorite thing!""It's an amazing app. I'm tracking my son's T1DM through it and it helps a lot. It's also very good that it can import all the CGM sensor data from other apps.""Very good graphic representation of data.""This would've been a 5 but they charged me automatically for 3 months service. When I first signed up I had no idea it was a subscription. I paid for 3 months because I had gestational diabetes then I'm suddenly charged nearly $14 again and guess what? Their Contact Us is bogus.... Unless you're cool calling Bulgaria! You have an app you'd think you could have an email?!""I am going to be uninstalling this app. At one point in time, it was my favorite diabetes app. This is no longer the case. I don't want to use Analytics and don't want to create another account. I want my data where it is and nowhere else. I also don't see why I have to create an account to link NightScout when the same is not required for linking Google Drive, Google Fit, or Dropbox. That is suspicious at the least. So long Diabetes: M.""Great, all-inclusive app. The beauty of the app is it's simplicity, yet depth. Diabetes:M allows for customization, since, like diabetes, no two cases are the same. Last, despite its simplicity, the app provides a number of charts, graphs and other important data that, even if its Greek to you, will be valuable to your healthcare provider(s). Moreover, as your experience with diabetes grows, so too will your knowledge and understanding of it the disorder and its respective data. Afterall, knowledge really is power! As you learn, the app supports your learning curve by providing as basic, or in depth of an analysis as you desire! Diabetes:M is the best diabetes app I've discovered on the Google Play Store thus far.""I upgraded to the current 2017 version because I bought a new phone. My old phone stopped updating over a year ago but this was a great app on the old phone, it was called Mydiabetes back then. Well, the new version has had a lot of features moved to a premium version and some features seem to be more missing completely. The meal entry is now horribly obtuse, I haven't been able to enter a single meal successfully on the new version and of course the custom database of foods that I had is gone. I can't find the medications reminder feature. My needs have also changed as I am also now a caregiver for a cancer patient so I need to track multiple profiles simultaneously. This app basically no longer meets my needs and seems to no longer meet my needs back when I was just caring for myself. I'll be uninstalling this once great app and look for a new app.""From the beginning I'm asked to agree to share my information with the developer's \"advertisement and analytics partners\" and I'm not given a choice. If I want to use the app, I must allow them to poke at my phone, browser and activities. I disagree.""I LOVE this app. I've used dozens of diabetes management apps, and this the only one I haven't deleted. It's got everything I could ever need, and it's nice to look at. Only problem? My new machine doesn't sync with the app, and the export data from the glucometer's native app won't import into Diabetes M. I've emailed your support with copies of the export data, but to date nobody has assisted me, even though I've done exactly what you requested in the User Guide. Can I get a little help please?""After testing over 100 diabetes apps, for the past few months, this is one of only two I'm still using. The rest have been uninstalled. The ease of entering data and the usefulness of the charts and reports have proven time and again that this is one of my favorites. 1/25/15  10/08/17 After all this time this is STILL the only diabetes app installed on my phone.""Love the graphs and information that you can print.""Using for canine, I can't find a canine diabetes app and this one seems to let me keep track of my canine diabetic on my mobile easily.  I have yet to try to print out the log or link to my laptop.""Great motivation to control my blood  sugar level. Very informative and useful for my doctor during my regular check up.""I love this app. Have used apps for one touch, accu-chek, etc. And non compare to this. Showed to Endrocronologist & dietician and they were very impressed with the amount of data in the reports""Excelent app, clear and easy to use. Love the ability to back up data to cloud services and you can always keep your results no matter if you switch device. Lots of choices as to what to save in each entry, glucose level, date, time, meal(dinner, lunch, etc) weight, just perfect.""Super easy to use, great features! I especially love that I can export my data to excel or a pdf to print for my doctor.""refuse to send my private info to server need a app with local secure database. unsecure""I love it!  Edit: I still love this app, I just have a lot of trouble committing to logging my numbers. I'm giving it another go and I plan to recommend the app to my new specialist as she had no decent suggestions for me.    I did read a previous review where someone had a problem with the \"NOT GOOD\" and other such message, and I can relate. Especially when I was a teenager, I would be criticized and blamed for all of my control issues when I had zero help from anyone and was managing as well as I could on my own. I don't think this person was wanting the app to \"lie\" to them as the response suggests, but more so didn't want to feel judged by an app that's supposed to make their control easier. Diabetes control is very personal and can be a sensitive subject and I think y'all would do well to show some compassion, even if you don't plan to make changes to the message. A more encouraging message also does not have to be a lie. Like showing the trend as high but encouraging someone to get back on track might go over better with some users.   Anyway rant over, this is still a great tool and I will continue to use it to help myself get back on track and stay there.  Thank you!""Love having the information at the tip of my fingers and easy to use""Need multiple user accounts to access the information.""This has help me to get my sugar back to a level that is healthy for me.""Love all the data and that the app tracks my god intake as well.   Looking for a while for this app""Navigating the app is not always easy but this is mitigated by the wealth of statistics that it supplies. It's obvious that a great deal of effort has been expended by the developer, and for that he should be commended. 8/26/17 Came back after a while away from the app. Now importing CGM data. App is painfully slow(Note 4).  App obviously cannot handle so much data. Down to 2 stars.""I absolutely love this app! I use it all throughout the day. It is so easy to use  and it not only helps me to keep track of my blood sugar but it allows me to input the foods I ate and keep track of my blood pressure , but not only that it it also allowed me to keep track of my workouts and weight as well. I have been able to take the information to my doctor and nutritionist so that they would be able to provide assistance accordingly. I truly love this app and recommend it to anyone!""If your a not so great at being a good diabetic like me , then you struggle with keeping track of your numbers and may also forget to check as often as you should . This app helps both those areas and will help your doctor to give you the right help with the correct information , it's hard for them to help with lack of information , becomes a best guess scenario. I highly recommend this app if you have type 1 , and also type 2""I used to love this app.  I bought the pro version, now when installing it on a new tablet, it won't let me update to the Pro version. It keeps asking for me to login and I never used the authors cloud, only my other paid cloud services. It won't even let me pay for it again, just to sync over two years of data onto my new tablet. I wrote the author and never got an answer.  I'm really pissed!""This is a very thorough app. However, the daily glucose overlay chart is backwards!! It is indeed rotated 180 dgs. It is puting first days data on last days. Confused me and my Dr. Please, fix.""Worst app, I installed for the first time...After registration says I already used the mail I'd or password. For three times with my three mail IDs tried but same address. My mobile security says this carries our device n contacts information.""Easy to use and very useful in tracking all my information. Also when I had a question and sent it by email, thet immediately responded. Very pleased because it makes me want to do better.""Love this app!  Easy to use and can track so much data!""I rely on this app to get detailed information about my diabetes. It is useful to show my provider.  If there were one improvement to make this more accurate, it would be an algorithm which gives the weighted average instead of the simple average based on the trend information .  For instance, a brief high blood sugar seems to be given the same emphasis as normal readings throughout the rest of the day. If you had one anomaly, that is given the same weight even though it may have last only for a short time period. Taking four blood sugar readings of 100 at 6 am, 100 at 12 pm, 200 at 4 pm (meal) , and 100 at 6 pm (post Prandial) would yield a simple average of 125 mg/dl for the day.  Instead, the average should be more heavily weighted to the number of hours throughout the day spent at 100. This can make huge difference if you don't measure from 6 pm to 6 am because you aren't eating anything.""Don't like the subscription model, the crippling of features if you don't sign up for an account, or the sharing of information with advertisers/partners.""Great app, I use it for my daughter and show the data to her Dr.""The best diabetes journal and database Android app, by far, to help keep track of all of your medical information in order to monitor your diabetic needs and progress. This very thorough app will compile all of your imported data into detailed reports along with various charts and graphs to be easily managed emailed to your doctor.""Wish the export was easier to attach to the email.  I like the idea of having the different insulin brands available to just click on.  I recently had to use fast acting insulin along with my Lantus slow acting insulin.  Having 2 places to put the units of insulin is great.""Overall great app, easy to use and very informative.""Love the app, tracks so much important data easily and generates charts and graphs   Original review: Great app, only using it for a week, it's probably going to replace Diabetes Journal, which I have been using for years""This (free version) works really well. Easy to enter and view data. Easy to get reports. I use it to track sugar, meds, blood pressure, food (not interested in minute detail). I replaced four other trackers with this app (including onetouch, contour,  acc-chk, and an independent app).""Really like the app and how i can track my BG and food intake. Wish the food had fiber in the main view.  Charts are ok, lots of data to present and helpful for a newly diagnosed type 2 like me trying to make sense of things.""Your greed has surpassed dew compassion. This app was great before the update. Some people cannot afford $5 a month for this app. DM meds cost &gt; $1000/month or more. Most don't have drug insurance all the time if at all.   All my DM patients (643 of them) were required to use this app. I used it too. But we won't anymore. I can't teach different methods based on what app someone uses. Since update it won't allow for home cooked foods and original recipes to be added to list and saved. What we have in canbed food list is too limited now. We get erroneous results.  Enjoy your millions. It was nice while we had it. Back to manual tracking for us.  Let's see, that's 643 users I sent your way and myself. I knew you'd screw it up sooner or later. Bye Bye.  Update: I have done everything tech support advised to too. The problems aren't isolated to me. I understand you believe your app works. But, I am looking at it, using it and now having to manually calculate recipes, enter them and have them not there next time. It was not like that before the update.   On my devices, the food lists are extremely limited and many brands that were once there are gone. Bar coding entry works now but doesn't save it. Before it would not scan but want was keyed stuck.  There are problems from my user end that weren't there before update. That's why the app rating went from 5 stars, and required use in my practice, to a 1 star. We do it manually and it's on paper, reusable because it wasn't delete. It will be there next time.  Be careful bugging folks to rate you. Sometimes people are silent for a reason. I got tired of being asked to rate you. I rated you honestly. Now you just can't understand why I have a problem. I don't have a problem because I am using other methods that work. I won't ask people to spend money monthly they don't have. People using your app have high expenses to start with and fixed income.   Sorry, but you asked my opinion and I gave it. Fix the problems. Its about humanity not the bottom line. At least, in healthcare it once was. I still hold true to that principle. How much \"free\" service is your company offering to those who truly can't cannot afford this app at any price as their doctors and meds have all there money.  Filks lije that simply say, \" It really helped, hate to loss it, but I have no more to give\".""Useful and color coded for easy reading and focus""Easy to use and everything seems functional, I had another one that after I put a month or so data in stopped responding""Keeping track of data is so simple on this good looking app, and the calculator for figuring out carbs and insulin takes a burden away. I find the graphs so helpful and motivating.""An all-inclusive app that helps keep track of just about every thing you need to monitor.  *** Update 20 April 2017 ***  In order to consolidate or transfer data, one must have an account. Sadly, to create an account, one must log in. But the server is unavailable. What good is that?  UPDATE 6 Jun 17 - FINALLY logged in to Analytics. Still cannot create premium subscription, but data is linked.""I'm so so sorry I didn't get the chance to edit this and yes I got your email, I just wanted to tell you I've been so busy with memorial day, birthday, funeral, deaths in the family, graduations, and mother's day. I haven't had time to do much, now my subscription is almost up and I haven't have to to use it until today, so please give me a second chance to use it please. I promise I will use it because I have to see my diabetic doctor on June 13th , please!\ud83d\ude00 To tell you the truth, I can't find any better app then this. But I kinda of want the old data base, because I have saved my old stuff and all I have to do is go to the list and there it is. This data base is too hard for me and I'm slow at things but I hate changes because it confuses me very much that it brings out my anxiety + Panic Attacks so severe, that's bad enough I have to relearn everything and remember it all. I go see my Diabetic doctor every three months, and I have to email all my results to see if she needs to change anything. But yes this app is helpful but most of all, my mom thinks 12 months $30.00 is too pricey but I didn't think so but that's my mother. I'm trying to get her to change her mind and take the 12/months but she won't because it's too pricey.""I didn't like the accident check meter with strips so I use the mobile casset which doesn't have bolus advice. So this app is perfect, since it does as it says and I always have my phone.""Very well designed app. If only this app could exchange diet and exercise information with S health and My Fitness Pal,  it would be so awesome.""After 2 years yesterday's update does not recognize purchased and installed premium license and asks for my email address which is no longer part of its own database. I'm now looking for a software that does not make its licenses obsolete. SUPPORT replied and pointed out the slight but significant-to-my-thumb location change to activate FatSecret database. I'm very happy again!""After trying several tracking apps and noticing that there were functions missing, i stumbled on this app. It is by far the best app on the market for tracking all pertinent information. It has a variety of reports and charts along with data backup. Glad i found it.  This app still rocks""Overall a very nice and useful app.  Email confirmation on ATT a little tenuous, but flawless on Gmail.""    ""net.mercy.mymercy"":     ""Page won't load, can't even get in.

When it works it is good.""Excellent all my information in one place""Sorry ppl wont give you anymore stars! You changed your system and it SUCKS now! We use to be able to go back over Dr visits, Dr notes, notes to and from Dr's and look at how many Rx's we could refill on a rx, but not anymore. Even my PCP was surprised when I showed him the system shows no refills, no matter if theres 0-10 refills!

A++++ I love you Dr.Syed internal medicine cliff drive.. So very compassionate and really cares about her patients. Love""I loved the old mobile site. Now there is no way to check my children's growth charts. Very disappointed with the new site and mobile app. Pretty much useless for me now.""Simple layout, quick and easy to use. More information than the MyMercy web site. Wish I had installed a long time ago.""Love this app! Much easier than logging into the website via the mobile site. Has nearly all features of desktop site, too! So far no issues whatsoever""Simply a great app to manage my health care!  Very intuitive and easy navigation.

""com.imprivata.imprivataid"":     ""    ""com.omada.prevent"":     ""Overall, it's a good app. Tracking food isn't so easy. I prefer my Fitbit app since it can scan the barcode and input the information quickly.""I think the food tracking system could be better. I wish it offered a way to track food nutrition data. I think I have better results when I see how many calories I consume. Also carbs vs protein, etc.""Needs nutritional information for food. How does tracking help if you don't know more information about calories fat and carbohydrates.""Easy to use and informative""Very easy to use. Great reminders to keep you on track and hold you accountable.""great group, great coach, great ideas backed by research and common sense, lots of therapeutic approach, and plenty of tools to make good sound habits and decisions. you won't be dissatisfied or disappointed in this investment in your physical and mental well-being!""I love this app. It's very informative, keeps my progress updated. I get reminders when I haven't tracked a meal. It motivates me, and keeps me engaged. I find it extremely helpful in my journey towards a lifestyle change.""I like the app a lot. It's very easy to use. It even syncs my steps over to Fitbit! The only things I wish it would do are to sync food and weight tracking with Fitbit. Weight is fine, and easy to copy over to Fitbit. But now that I track food in Fitbit (to get calorie and daily budget information), it doesn't have a way to go to Omada, so my health coach can see it and have a better idea of what I'm doing.""Excellent App. Helps to start good habits & keeps you accountable. Fun to see progress with each entry. Tracking food, activity & weight loss gives confidence and motivates me to continue toward my goal.""Great app for the most part. The only thing I would change is that I wish it would be possible to link a Myfitnesspal account to it to reduce having to enter tracking data in multiple places.""It's difficult to go back previous days to record food.""Super easy to use and informative. Tracks progress, total game changer for me.""Love the app! Keeps me accountable.""very informative""Love the app, makes it easy to log my meals, read the lessons, check my steps and look back on my progress.""I think before they posted this app, they should have made sure it works. On my phone i can't view the resources, even though in one part of the tracking it shows you tracked everything, on a another part it says you didn't. When i contact customer service they gave me a lame excuse that after you enter you have go yo another screen & then go back. That didn't work & you should not have to do that.""I signed up I got my program stuff immediately it says my email is invalid and my password is no good so I can't reset my password and it won't let me sign up0""Since the latest update, the app no longer opens.

Helps me with accountability and keeps  me connected to my goals.""Appreciate the program. Helps me with accountability.""Still a little buggy. Updates to entries and syncing with PC is slow and at times inaccurate. UPDATE: Lost a \u2606. Prior Fitbit synced data gets lost and needs to be reentered for accurate long term tracking. Update: getting worse!""It's amazing... makes accountability REAL!!!""I love this app and all that it has to offer. I love that the scale is linked automatically to my coach. I  need that accountability it's helping me stay on track. All of the resources provided are great and I love the skills tab also.""Tracking and accountability help me to succeed in losing weight.  The app is really easy to use.  I love that the scale sends the weigh-ins directly to the app.""I would love to see some of the features available online on the app. I don't own a computer. My coach sent me a link to it and I was amazed by all the information available to me I might have missed""The app is easy to use, wish it had a little more nutrition information available (more of a program problem, not the app itself)\ud83d\ude09""I've been using this app since April 16th 2017. It's glitchy to say the least.  I'm currently on Unit 2.4 of the program lessons. Why did the app stop recording at 1.4? It's helpful at times, but a pain in the ass when it stops working! I've uninstalled it multiple times, and gone back to the Web program several times. The only convenience with the app, is you don't have to continuously log-in as you do with the website to record your data. That is the only reason I like it!""Easy and informative so far""I like what i see so far. Haven't really had a chance to fully use it, just got back situated from the 2016 flood.""Its awesome except for the messaging/text function, you can't go back n fix anything without erasing the whole text.

Thank you Omada \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764""Informative and geared to each individual. Covering most health aspects.  So glad that I started this program.""Somethings changed in the app (or maybe in app on my phone) - it's not saving/tracking the steps I enter, I've tried multiple times entering steps for last several days and when I disconnect & log back in they're gone...I've uninstalled & reinstalled app a few times, didn't fix it.....wassup?""Very easy to use and very informative. Also on top of it when there's a problem.""Easy to use. Wish there was a summary or review of past meals and weights. But I can look back day by day. Nice user interface.""I love this app, by weighing every day and tracking my food I'm being held accountable for my health. Love the weekly lessons and skills.""I've personally embraced this app as my own accountability police for making healthy choices and exercising. It's easy to use so no excuses when it comes to logging and checking in. I live it!""It helps me make better choices when I know I will record what I eat.   Being held accountable is a great tool to success.""Loses food and activity data. I haven't found the pattern yet. It's inconvenient to re-enter data (which I'm tracking elsewhere in apps that don't lose the data). So inconvenient I may delete the Android app and just use the web page.   It would be a better app if it didn't lose data and just asked Yes-No questions rather than the clunky entering of food and activity. While it's good to get people thinking about what they are consuming and whether they perceive it as large or small amounts or healthy or not, the app just isn't reliable.  It seems to hold onto the weight data --imagine that!-- tied to Omada's proprietary scale, which is also inconvenient compared to the Withings scale we have.""For the most part,  the app works well.  It remembers previous food you enter in app for easy selectio on another day, however,  only for the meal you entered it in. For instance,  if you had an Apple for snack and then another day ate an apple for lunch,  you would have to enter it again.  I also have issues with trying to enter food or exercise for a previous day.  I select the day,  enter all of the info,  save it only to find it entered it in the current day.  You have to delete the info and start all over and make sure you are in the right day. Plus,  it doesn't save what you just entered because you are going back a day.""Easy to use app but would be nice if it had more of the same information as the website and used more of the information from the fitness tracker I use (fitbit charge 2). Having to log data on both apps is redundant and takes too much time out of my day. Used this app on a Galaxy note 5 and S8. Worked well on both phones.""Easy to use. Helps you stay accountable.""Very easy to use. Like the fact that it's always with me. No opportunity to backslide on data entry. Works well with my Samsung tracker for steps.""The apps functionality is easy to navigate as well as cues you in,when you're not sure if you're entering information correctly""It make logging meals so easy, and allows me to go back to a prior day and fill in a meal I my have missed.""Helpful tracking.  Well organized access to all my data.  No access issues experienced""This app keeps me accountable but there are glitches with the mobile version.""Very informative and helpful. Great app.""Great accountability!""I like the app and program. It does make it easier to keep track of foods with the app, versus on my computer, but I also was use to myfitnesspal app and was use to being able to scan products codes and have accurate item, servings and calories. That would be nice in this app!""I love this app!. It is easy and convenient to use, even for a super busy mom of three. I'd recommend it to everyone!""When you get onto group, most times it does not come up. Now, when I want to trak my dinner, it doesn't come up! Uhg. Dont know why or what to do when it does that. So all I do is go back to it later and try again! Also, when I pair S health to omada, it killed my battery, so I can't pair them, and I have to manually enter my steps.""Omada keeps me on track by making me accountable.""The accountability and reminders in this app has been extremely helpful in my journey.  Additionally, the connectivity with Google fit makes tracking progress even easier.""Wish there was a bar code reader.""Good app. The accountability through the assigned group makes it great.""Editing on a mobile is difficult since the keyboard covers the entry area and you can't see what you typed.""Amazing app!! Coach gives great advice and support , also the tracking makes you accountable for your actions ( decisions)""It's awesome!! The c reminders, coach and tracking really help me be accountable to my health.""Lessons very informative and daily weigh in  makes you more aware of what you have eaten the effectit has""Delay in updating and slow corresponace with fitbit.""Easy way to keep track of information.""I really like the program. It helps me to stay focused about eating healthy. Before I eat something I now think how it is going to affect my health and hold me back from reaching my goal.""The weigh in accountability makes want to do better one meal at a time.  Overall, the app works""Need to improve the editing and appending the meal input process. Once you enter any information and it has been accepted and listed it can not be edited nor appended if made a mistake or forgot something you want to add to a current input.""Very easy to use and helps to keep me accountable. The only thing I wish it had is water tracking.""I can only get to the skills portion thru email, but everything else works great and keeps me on track.""I find this app very user-friendly and informative.""The app keeps everything at my fingertips which helps keep me on track and motivated.

Wish the days were still colour coded though so you could see overall eating patterns. It would be nice to be able to set a different step goal also. Overall user friendly and generally intuitive.""Very user friendly.

The \"skills\" tab, the group weight loss, etc.""Easy to use and informational.""Needs to connect to more devices.  Nice and basic food tracker... Haven't found a way to edit previous days from mobile app.""I love how it reminds me to track myself and to in put missed information. Very easy to use.""The app is not fully developed like the website...so you constantly have to go back and forth,if u care enough. Or just give up and stay on the app and use only what they offer there... Could be better""It's food tracking is a little clunky . I prefer the my fitness pal food tracker. If you don't log satirday night, there appears to be no way to go back when it moves to the next week. I love the rest of it and how it links to my fitbit for fitness tracking and weight. One stop shopping fish great. Just some kinks to get better on the food side""Wish it more information with regard to her food like calorie count and some nutritional information like that""This is a fantastic app that allows you to fully participate the Omada health program. I use is almost daily to check my weights, steps and input the food.  Omada figured out the right combination of techniques, technology, group interaction and mild competition to get weight down for any person. I like data driven decision makings,  and this works out great for me. I wish more employers sponsor this program.""I use other apps for the same things & the work better!  No BMI listed.

I get texts and emails from my doctor to confirm appointments.  They send me bills, I know where my Doctor's office is, and  I'm not sure why I'd go through an app to talk to my doctor.  My biggest problem is that you can't see the appointments for your kids or other family members.   It would be nice if one login was connected to the whole family.""I don't understand the point of having this app.      *POINTS*  You can keep track of your appointments, great but you can do that on your phone calendar. You can send messages to them, great but no one seems to respond back to you so what's the point of that?  You can keep track of how much you owe, great, just ask them. You can get directions where they are located, just Google it.  I really don't understand having this app.""Will send text or email to complete registration.""I am unable to verify the account for the link that was sent to me by email and or text.

When it decides it doesn't want to, it deletes some of your data without warning. When you go back to edit a day, or add a day in the past, or delete a note, it has been glitching and deleting several days worth of information. I was hoping to reliably use this app to track pain and show my doctor what has been going on, but it looks like I can't fully trust this app if several days get deleted for no reason when I am doing other things on the app.""Great app very useful, just wish I could connect it to my Fitbit account""I like it informative""Why need account to use its no ones business about my health.""It's very informative!""This app has helped me take control of my fibromyalgia and lets me analyze everything from triggers to relief methods. It's always being updated to add more information into your daily logs.""Very good log program and help but needs to modify to accomodate Canadian patients such as postal code and insurance type you have no option to add on WSIB insurance? But yeah keep up the good work.""This app is fantastic. It allows me to keep track of possible triggers for my condition and then I can share the information with my specialist via an emailable report. The articles within the app are interesting and it's always good to see how others are helping their pain via the various statistics. All in all, a great app and one I would highly recommend to any pain sufferer.  The latest update has made the process of logging past days far easier, proving that the developers do listen to their users""I suffer from memory issues so this is perfect to help me keep track of everything & it has easy to print pain report to give to your doctor.""I really like this app however the areas of pain choices in the back and front need to be a little smaller and more specific""Great reminder tool to talk with my MD about. Maybe needs to expand out for alliments and maybe up date zip code info. We do not have zip codes in Canada.""Great app for documenting pain. I would give a 5 if you could enter information for previous days (in case you forgot), and if there were more choices for parts of the body""The app is ok. It's really annoying to be spammed with \"insights\" every time you make an entry. Also the reports/history are not very useful. Frustrating that you can't easily go back and make an entry if you accidentally skip a day.""Love the app in many ways, wish the areas of indication were a little more fine-tuned so I could indicate hip pain vs low back pain for example.""For those with chronic pain this is a great app for tracking your pain and medications. Recent updates have now included medication dosage. Could we also get a time medication was taken? What I love is that I can email my Dr reports from the app. Occasionally the program has issues loading and submitting logs, but this could be my bad internet connection. Worth downloading and giving it a try!""Seems to work great with my phone.  Excellent for being free. I was looking to buy it.  They are very quick in adding things such as my birth defect.   ***It would be nice to be able to add all of my daily meds...  So I wouldn't have to add daily (whether for pain or not)   I love I can email my file to a doctor or friend.""The history reports are great for self monitoring, remembering, my progress and expressing the same to my medical help. Minor refinements, like dividing the head and back into sides, on the Pain Log character would better match migraine and other pain modes.  Overall a great tool.""Good app but doesn't send email when.requested""It help jog your memory when reporting to doctor. Helps me connect any re-occurring triggers for pain.""I have taken medication for chronic pain and it helped but several months ago I had an obstruction  of the bowel my doctor told me that I would have to go to a pain clinic but I couldn't afford it because I work and my insurance doesn't pay for a whole lot and the pain clinic is so far like 25 to 30 miles and now I am getting this numbing sensation in my back rib cage and right leg down to my knees and my knees keep hurting very bad.

I get more information stored in one place.""I've just started so I might have to alter rating at a later time.  It won't allow me to submit some info without doctor's email which is not available to me.""It's a good way to chart my life instead of relying on my memory. This will help my Pain.

Another of my Docs with a God Complex since my 3 failed back surgeries from '13-'14""Awesome ...easy to use...insightful information.""Out dated useless does not offer current information  and leaves out many pain areas that effect chronic pain sufferers. Don't bother""The PainScale app is something that has been needed for a long time. The information that it provides is invaluable, from understanding pain, treatments, and tracking. A must have app for those with chronic pain.""I have been living with chronic pain for over 14+years, so by now I've seen a few different pain apps. My Painscale is the first pain app that I actually found really useful and didn't cost what seems like a small fortune to use. It's free! Not that 15 logs free.  It's simple and easy to use. It will measure not just your pain but also: activity level, treatments and medications used to treat your pain that day,  emotions and sleep. Finally something that looks at all of us.  Instead of having us just blindly guess a number, each has a constructive description to help you pick the right number.   It does what a tracker should do - track things. It will learn what options you use most often to deal with your pain & only show you those.  It will show you insights into how your pain & how you deal with it compares to similar uses on the app.  It makes reports you can send to your doctors and anyone else you need. It also has a large amount of helpful information in easy to digest form, including articles, videos, exercise, meditations - all in one.  I would recommend this app to anyone, from those just starting their journey with pain to seasoned veterans!""Have had lower back pain since a high school football injury.  It was technically the marching band flag football game, but an injury's an injury.  This app is a great way to track my pain and remind me to do my exercises.  It's also great to learn about new pain management techniques now that I'm not going to PT all the time.""I'm using this to monitor my gout attacks, now I'm eating less Korean BBQ which I miss but the addition to more fruit to my diet is resulting in less gout pain :-)""    ""com.amila.kickcounter"":     ""Very easy to use and informative \ud83d\ude0a""Very easy to use.

I uninstalled and reinstalled lost all my data and it's still not working!""Really easy to use! I like that you can back out of it if there are a couple minutes between kicks so that your phone isn't just occupied with this app. It's really easy to just go back when you feel another one, switching between what you're doing.""Simple to use and very helpful. I think more information would be useful though, a bit more detailed I didn't exactly understand what to record at first glance .""Easy and nice to use. It would be helpful if we can email or print the kick count history. Please try to include this option.""The counting portion of the app worked great.  I just couldn't access the trends and information tabs without the app closing.""Love the ease of use and that the data is available per recorded session and as a bar graph of 4 hourly intervals.   But why does it group all the data into one sey of 24 hourly data.  I want to see a bar graph showing the 4 hourly intervals with data for each day to be able to compare days of movements recorded.  There's no usefulness in showing a graph that just adds up the kicks per 4 hourly time frame of each day to give a total of all the days. That doesn't help to dostinguish between pattern changes""Great app. Continues to count in the background while I Do other things on my phone unlike other apps that start a new session if you back out.

Wish it was truly free.""Wish there were flash cards or option to make some...but overall love this app!!!""Great Memory Joggers""Love this app! The information is easy to understand and super easily accessible on the go. I've only rated it a four because I'm hoping more content will be added in the future!""I like the app, it was informational but there were very little amounts of slides that were actually free.""I really love the app! My only critique is that you should input the digital index cards. Overall the app is great!""If your a nursing student download this! This is so much awesome information that you will need for class. FYI I rarely rate apps but this one needed praise. This costs $10 but let's be honest that miniscule compared to any of the books we buy for class!""There are a lot of spelling errors on the cheat cheats cards!

I took the time to call the number provided.  From that conversation we guessed that it wants to verify my email address also.  The unsolvable problem is that I have a record with NO email on their computer, so since the email field is required there is no possible entry I could use to register this app.  So far the app is *useless* to me and all the error conditions *should have been* tested by the developer.  Here are the problems:  1) There is no way to say \"continue anyway\" if you get this message.  (There is no way to to *anything* except you phone's back button)  2) If this message really means \"your email address doesn't match what we have on file\", then SAY that.  And tell me how I could be \"on file\".  3) better yet, DO NOT use the email as a verification.

I do recommend it.  HOWEVER, I am uninstalling and getting a refund based on principle alone. The fact that I have to buy it for every device is not, in my opinion, acceptable. It should be by account. Doesn't matter if it's 99 cents or 99 dollars.""Very informative and with 6 pets I put it to use often.

If it had a tummy time timer it would be even better.""Does not have an option to track twins information. For  singletons this works for twins sadly it does not. Good idea though.""Very easy to use. The pattern function is great, it allows you to identify emerging patterns in your baby's sleeping and feeding.  This is the best tracking app i've used. I also find the tips and articles very useful.  Being able to download the information to a PDF is a bonus. I will include the growth charts in my baby book.""Useful and easy to use - I use it daily to track my newborn's bottles and breastfeeding time.   One thing - it would be a lot easier to read the data if the daily and weekly bar charts had values attached to each bar. When the grading of the table is every 50 or 100 mililitres it is somewhat easy to guess but when the table is graded every, say 250 mls, it is so difficult to interpret - and values attached to each bar would take guesswork out of such a precise app and make it more user friendly.""I didn't like the app because it was not well adjusted for other countries standards. I was not able to put in my babies information by Canadian standards there for app got confusing. Good app layout though, looks simple to use when multitasking with a newborn""Really useful app for tracking feeds, nappies etc. Easy to use and with a good UI. The only thing I think it's missing is ab ability to export the raw data to csv or something similar. I'd quite like to keep the data for posterity and not be dependent on having access to the app in the future.""A staple since our newborn arrived. Simple to use and data analysis is invaluable to communicate with health care professionals what our child has been doing.""I like it you can get a lot of information on it""Would love to use this app however it wont let me make an account just because i still use my hotmail account and I'm not going to make a new email just for an app -_-""I love the app, however, I've noticed when it converts the information to a daily review it doesn't actually add up with the information given...e.g. stating this a particular day baby slept 19 hours when in fact it states in the breakdown it was 16 hours. Telling me baby fed most on a particular day when it was one of the lesser feeding days. Other than that (I keep written record myself of daily totals thankfully), it's easy to record and access information, nicely set out, aesthetically appealing and I like how some tips flash up throughout the day/week too.""I rated with only 4 stars instead of 5 because uGrow allows to export data only as charts and I would like to have them on print as a resume by day.""Handy to look back and remind myself when the baby last ate or had his nappy changed. Would be handy to see summary at end of each day and as you go along. It only seems to summarise certain days.""The App has glitches, once you record time at times it will erase your entry. In addition, there times it shows no information entered.""This is my first day of using the app. My wife usually is doing the recording bit, but I have logged in using same account so we both can stay on top of things. Ease of recording is the best part. I am yet to see full effectiveness of the app, hence low rating. App has sync issue, feeds recorded in one device is not showing on other. Will be good to have alerts for feeds, and what developments to expect week wise. Otherwise nice app.""**update** 31/10. Short cut buttons are back to how they were before last update. Thanks you for listening an fixing the below issue. Rating now back up to 5 from 2! Fab app still using it nearly  5 months on.   Been using this app since I came out of hospital. Before the update when i clicked on the plus icon it used to show me the three icons i used the most (nappy bottle sleep). Now since the update no matter how many bottles i log it still shows breastfeeding as one of the top three options. I wasn't able to breastfeed this time round and now i am reminded of this everytime i log a feed!!...thanks...please fix this or I'll be search of a app that doesn't rub it in my face of what a failure i am.""Sometimes,after editing the sleeping period it doesen't save, it jumps back to the anterior saving!""Very helpful in tracking information and being able to provide accurate data to healthcare providers. Is there a way to add an additional profile for the other parent?""Won't let me put baby's actual birth date just has it set as the day i downloaded. It skips up to the top of the timeline when I try to look back down the timeline. Also it's a pain to add past events to because of you don't change date first it resets everything you put on that event. Please fix, this has potential to be a great app""(I use my husband's google account btw) This app has been everything to me! I was struggling to log all my babies feedings and soiled diapers. Then I figured there HAD to be an app that could make this easier! Thank the heavens above I found uGrow! Highly recommended especially if you breastfeed and your baby has jaundice!!!!""I really like it. I wish there was are  setting for preemies so that I could get more accurate milestone information. It's user friendly and I like the breastfeeding timer when I remember to use it! Wish I had this app when I was in NICU and we were timing and recording the length of his breastfeedings.""Great app to track feeds, expressing and sleeps. It really helps to show patterns. Very informative would definately recommend""Love this app!! Just what I need to keep track of feeds, sleep & baby's weight \ud83d\ude0a the only thing thats a bit fiddly is how you enter the bottles...the slider is very sensitive & I always put in the wrong amount & have to edit the entry afterwards. Amazing app to monitor my baby's needs though...will be recommending to other mum's!""Have been using this app for months, it's really good but since the last update it does not save amendments to my data. So I add the start of his sleep and change the time when he wakes up, but it doesn't save the amendment. Which is really frustrating! Would also like the graph to show exact total of milk ml each day rather than a bar.""Really love this app, it is a great way to record your babys sleep and feeding habits and more!!!!  I love the 'pattern' display which allows you to compare day by day allowing you to determine where patterns are starting to occur, exactly what i wanted. It would be great to see some improvements but overall best app i have come across for this purpose. Improvements i think which would make this app amazing include - would like to be able to scroll the week layout just a few days, currently scrolling just scrolls by an entire week -  this limits your ability to compare days (when you reach the start of the week, you cannot easily compare with the last few days of the week prior). - ability to zoom the WHO weight chart, currently too small to really see what percentile your child lies. Although the colour gradient of the chart helps a little. - easy way to log the end of a nap. Currently i log the start, then i have to edit when child wakes which is 7 user presses (account - my data - sleep - log - last log - edit - end time) then it is 5 user presses to return to normal screen   (close - back arrow - back arrow - back arrow - exit account)....could go on but run out of space.....""So far I really like it.  Only wish you could set alarms for things like feeding and expressing.  I have to use a second app for that.  Also, is this app backing up my data? I don't see that option.  I'm worried I'll lose all my tracking if something happens to my phone?  Update- Thanks for responding.  I tried to add to my husband's phone but when I tried to retrieve my password, it told me I couldnt because I had a social account.  Does that mean my data isn't being backed up and how can I convert to a real account to add to my husband's phone?  Tia.""I loved this app up until this morning when it has stopped updated the data between my wife's phone and mine. It always did and no suddenly it gas stopped otherwise it would be 5 stars. Any help please?""Great app for new parents, would like the ability to log on with 1 email address but share inputs with another. (Mum or Dad creates the account & shares with the partner). Currently to get around this problem I have to log on with my account on 2 phones.""Setting up the app is very easy.  Enter some details about your child and click save.  The instructions provided  are easy to understand. Place the thermometer in the ear of your child. Press and hold the power button. It then clicks and temperature is taken. You then transfer the data to the app on you phone and the information is kept.  The good thing about this app is if you check your child's temperature on a daily basis you will  notice a change when it suddenly increases.  Well done Philips & Google.  My only negative is why do you need a photograph?""Great app. Good for logging feeds and nappies. Would be 5 star if there was a section to add pics at say 0 months 2 months 4 months etc. Like a memory book but great app""Handy to keep track of babies habits/weight/etc for first time parents. New update is brutal tho, all info is absent upon opening & takes a really long time to load so you can't quickly check when the last feed or diaper was which is super frustrating. Hopefully they can fix that asap!  As if May 11 still having the slow loading issue & it's making me think about finding a different app to teach info. When my baby is hungry the fact that I can't open it & immediately see which side I'm supposed to feed from is not helpful. Please fix this & don't give me your canned response I've seen to multiple other reviews.""Used to love this app but since the update all my data has been lost! It's also slow to load, doesn't save data inputs easily any more and always asks me to log back in. Moving to another, more reliable app!   Update: moved to 4 stars after the app was updated and all my data was restored. Thank you! The app is now working perfectly well, much faster, but could do with a few UI changes to make some of the features slightly easier (sleep timer should be first not the manual page, bottle volumes should be a filter as currently it's hard to select amount easily).""I'm not sure what is going on with the app whether someone is working on it to get all the bugs out or not but it's been ridiculous lately. Data charted shows up twice, doesn't refresh and if it does it takes FOREVER to do so. Now I can't even go back to previous day to see individual sleep periods etc. I'm ready to find a new app.""I liked the app before... The update did improve some things like sum the total feeds a day but also gave us a lot of bugs. I have a glitch where I have today and yesterday as \"today\" and \"the day before yesterday\" is \"yesterday\". And info tabs about feeding is always about breastfeeding while I only bottle feed. edit: I see no need to see day logs of days of in the future, I can keep scrolling forward through the dates while no data has been inputted""I liked the app but lost all the 3 months data after the update.""Worst app. If I could rate zero stars I would. My baby's saved info was just wiped clean. I am a busy mom of two, this app \"helped\" keep track of my baby. Don't waste your time.""Loved it until the last update now it takes ages to load, looks like it's lost all data then eventually loads it up.""Was a great app until the update which removed 4 months of data.  Now it won't load new data and erases entries. I'm uninstalling it and finding another app.""I've been using this for 6 months but now every time I open it takes ages to load all the data. It was fine before the update, but now it is painfully slow.""since the update everytime i open it now my data has been lost and it takes a few mins to update. i use this all the time so can this please be fixed""Updated and lost all information""I love this app! It really helps me track and remind myself when it's time to do things for and with the baby.

Other than that I love the app""Very useful in tracking feeds and sleep but keeps loosing data and closing unexpectedly""App keeps logging me out and wiping all the data away when I log back in!

Checking the battery is not very accurate or identified on how to do it accurate""Needs better control information to let you know what the changes you are looking at will do to the hearing aids.""Very good application.  It would be better if it could be bidirectional.  It sends data to hearing aids but doesn't read current settings from device.""Stopped working after a few weeks on a Galaxy S6. Can't figure out what changed.  Update:  Support got back to me and fixed it with the following info :  An update to your Galaxy S6 may have added sound \u201cfeatures\u201d\u00a0 from the S7. These sound features are known to interrupt our Smart Remote app.  Both of these are in the Sounds and vibrations settings. At the bottom of this screen is and advanced item called \u201csound quality and effects\u201d. There is an equalizer represented by two dials. These dials need to be pointed up at 12:00. Also there is a feature called \u201cConcert Hall\u201d This needs to be turned off. This should allow your phone to communicate to your hearing aids""I really enjoy being able to adjust sounds I hearing   like the back ground noise.""high pitched  in Can t people taking to me or t.v.  getting money back""I like everything about the app EXCEPT when using directional settings, they revert back after only a few minutes. I am often in situations where I need the directional settings for a longer time. It is highly frustrating to get the settings tuned just right only to lose them in a matter of a few minutes. Surely this could be programmed with either adjustable times or to leave the directional settings in place until cancelled by the user.""The battery algorithim needs to be improved to better account for the discharge curve. Wish I could adjust each ear separately.""A bit flakey. Mute doesn't always work. Doesn't exactly fly open at launch. Would like more user controlled settings without running back to my audiologist.""Your presentation screen is lacking in that features are not simply listed. Your mute symbol could be of a more universal standard.

It used to be there.  How do I get it back?""Convenient, but slow""Works fine.  It only sends messages to aids so doesnt give displays.  Tinnitus depends aids abilities. Have tried it out for awhile now.  Would be nice if the directional mikes didn't \"time out\" after awhile, or if there was an option to \"lock them in\"  and not be randomly awaiting for them to change back to default mode.  Although the battery checker is neat in concept, it is not very helpful.  The discharge curve is so flat that there's very little warning when batteries are giving up.  Interesting seeing all the comments about battery checker not working, or not working on right side.  Mine occasionally doesn't work on right side, but, rebooting (open battery door, wait a few seconds and reclose) has always worked.  Also if you're having troubles making things work, you can try increasing signal level""Brand new S7 Kirkland Signature hearing-aids. Samsung S7 phone. Absolutely will NOT tell me what the battery level is on my right hearing aid. No \"beeps\", yet the left side works perfectly.  I have re-paired my hearing aids at least 20 times. Also uninstalled the app, then re-installed. Still nothing.  As a software developer myself, this type of bug is unacceptable, and indicates that whomever is writing the code is not up to the task.  Easy fix. Shouldn't take a real programmer more than a few minutes. Just because you are giving the app away doesn't mean that it everything doesn't have to work.""It is not doing what it was told to me that it would do. It does not give me the level of my batteries this is one of the main things that I thought was good. I had to take this back and have it reset and it worked for a while and now it's gone again I am very disappointed in this app""Works about 5% of time. Each scan of the QR code delivers different results. Sometimes just the volume works and nothing else. Sometimes 2 or 3 functions work but usually nothing works.""App kept disappearing off phone. Went back to store and found out blue tooth needed to be on.""You can not hearing direction in noise mode. Still to much of a hasle . Need something to slow wind noise , with wind and in noise mode you still can not here someone standing next to you.

Due to having 3 different phones I feel the need to rate this application accordingly per phone.       After having ample opportunity to use this app in its entirety on my newest device, I am pleased that my rating still has not changed. Giving this app 5 stars \ud83c\udf1f is simple. That goes for all three different cell phone I've had while using this application.. There's never been any issue with any one of them. Which I am seriously pleasantly surprised with that fact. I seem to have issues with most apps I use but thankfully not with this particular one. Listed below are my personal opinions and thoughts regarding the app itself. I'm including such a lengthy rating in hopes it helps someone else who is looking for a app such as this one.       It does NOT interfere at all with any of what I may be doing on my phone & or with any of my apps that I have installed on my phone. It runs very smoothly & to say this app is non evasive is totally putting it mildly. \ud83d\ude01  This also includes applications that may be in use & or running in the background at any given time      Also it has NOT effected my battery life WHAT SO EVER & I have paid close attention to my battery usage. Considering I have it in use 24/7 this is a HUGE PLUS.I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS APP..!!.. There's ONE MORE huge Plus .There\u2019s NO ADS.\u2757\u2755\u2757\u2755\u2757 Whoo Hoo.      Before ending this rating I wanted to include something that I personally feel is honestly the most important fact in regards to this app.. This application does wonders for ppl with any types  of eye sensitivities. I have extremely sensitive eyes. As well as having a few different eye issues which have caused me major pain and discomfort. I have excessive dry eye syndrome along with blurry vision, major sensitivity to the brightness of the of phone especially. The sensitivity is even severe when the phones brightness is at its lowest possible setting.. Which in turn, caused me major  headaches, even migraines. Since using this application my headaches and migraine have decreased and my eyes honestly feel so much more relaxed and they are causing less blurry vision while I'm using my phone. I can only contribute this to using this app as I do. What a difference..!!.. All thanks to this incredible app. Gotta say special thanks to the Creator and developer.. To who ever thought of this app... GENIUS.!. .""I was involved in a horrific car wreck 10yrs ago.leaving me with a broken neck,fractured skull,blown eardrums,fractured back,and both collarbones broke.

For the money BCBS is taking out of my check, I should be able to see my account on my phone at ANY given day or time.""It does not work. I tried to log in on a desktop and through android and nothing. Piece of crap. Why have it if it does not work.  Either improve it or I'll take my business elsewhere""I registered online, received the email. Still can't log in. I've called, talk to customer service, even screenshot my screen like my csr asked me to do so y'all could see the issue and emailed it to your tech support. Still haven't received any type of call back or email from them. Guess y'all use the same lie to fake reassure us it's hope in repairing this app. Still waiting on my insurance card to come in the mail but my February bill is already here. Smh. Call customer service she was confused. Told me my dental card was my insurance card but the card says dental only on it. Didn't think I would still be waiting on my card to come when I registered and paid before the deadline last year. Can't even attempt to show my doctor my digital card from your app because it doesn't work. I don't have no type of paperwork describing what type of insurance I have, what is covered, nothing. All I have is a bill that's on time. Nothing else. I need my welcome packet, my health insurance card immediately or I will call the market place back, ask to switch to another insurance and get my money back from BCBSGA this is ridiculous. Fix the issues instead of brushing over them.""I work all day long. I wanted the app so that I can easily access everything. It sent me an email thanking me for registering, but I can not log in...""Can't log in.ive called several times for assistance. Even the temporary password doesn't work!! Easier to just call for customer service to see if my Dr in network!!! A WASTE!!!!""It will not let me log in to my account""I don't have an ID card, I called too many times but nobody send it to me  I tried to download the app so I can get an ID. But I Can't find it.""You're better off just using the web browser to go to the website. Menus don't scroll, ID card doesn't display, and very little information is provided that isn't already on the insurance card. The few useful things it could do are pretty much barred off by the scrolling problem.""Every time I  try to see details on claims it says something isn't working and to try back later. This still hasn't been fixed and it's been happening ever since I downloaded the app.""Can't remember password, can't change it. Not worth the effort. Uninstalled.""Accurate information quick and easy to access""You can't access your card without your I'd no. on the card, so if you don't have your card it's useless""This app has all the info that we could possibly need while on the go. We've got access to all our ID cards, plus all my medical history. And it found an optometrist close to us.""My insurance information is right in my hands!!!!""Works well on LG G3. Lots of useful information on local docs and all of my previous procedures and medications. Nice reference when you need to remember dates and dosages, dr. phone numbers and such.""I was having technical issues with the app that have now been resolved. I would hope that the app had more detailed information available. It would be helpful if the app had the option to rate the providers, that way when the next person is looking for a doctor in that area, they can see reviews.""ID card has error and will not load""Not able to pull up my card. Get an error message every time.""I would rather have the old slow version than a new non functioning one! With all of the technology these days cant yall hire someone who knows what they are doing!""Error message everytime I try to view cards.  :-(  totally defeats the purpose of having the app.""Will not show I'd cards keeps having error and call.... When try to view doctors or plan days technical issues and crashes!""Stops running when attempting to view id cards""Each time you update I have to re-remember my password why cannot you fix that""I would have thought that BCBS would have a great app. I am actually embarrassed for them as it is so Terrible! I want to be able to see my claims and prescription information and more!  But I guess that should not be too surprised as that function does not even work properly on their website. Come on BCBS. Is IS 2014 and you need technology which reflects that! I would seriously start to review your IT department's capabilities.""    ""com.simplecontacts.scapp"":     ""The app gave me initial differently, but once I was finally able to log in, I took the eye exam and made my purchase. The team sent me a text and an email once my order was submitted. I wrote back with a question and they gave me an honest and helpful answer right away, then continued a dialogue with me to make sure I was content.

""com.hp.babyapp"":     ""Deleted all my data from yesterday to now!""This was great on my iPhone but recently switched to android on my new huawei and the app runs soo slowly!

On a positive, I love how I can now make the times specific.""Tried to create an account said my email was already in use. So tried to log in with my usual password, said it was incorrect so reset it. Still says my password is incorrect. Looked for contact information for customer support and only found email for privacy concerns.""I used this app. for 3 months and today suddenly a complete Month erased from my data(last diapers,sleep,reed and year book too) what should i do now!!""I cant log back into my account after i switched phones .. lost all my daughter growth information.   Keeps saying : invalid token session""Kept saying wrong password so I changed it at least 4 times still doesn't work. Uninstalling""This is a great app i would have given 5 stars if you could sync app with partner so if you are out they can add data.""It would be just perfect if it let you sync with another caregiver. I will have uninstall and use another app because of that. Too bad :/  Edit: Thank you for your reply. I'll try that and get back you you. Although it's not the same as synching with other accounts.""This has everything! You can log feeds and changes and sleeps with so much detail. You can save daily pictures, milestones with pictures, memories. It has guides, weekly info, breastfeeding videos. This is just the complete essential app for new mums. I love the pregnancy app so downloaded this one. My baby is 3 days old and I already love this app so much. I never leave reviews but really wanted to for this! :)""It's really really useful. It's really helping me keep track of the feedings, nappy changes and I love the yearbook. Unfortunately, I'm giving it only 3 stars because it's very slow on my phone (Fair Phone 2), it stops responding for no apparent reason, and it is constantly sending a notification saying if I want to keep recording the feed session...but there is NO feed session active. In addition, the lullabies and white noise do not stop automatically if I answer the phone...really annoying.""I like it. Specially that I can make a memory picture of my baby life. Only I wish that I could write a comment at solid, what we are starting eat.""It worked really well on my iPhone. But when I switched to an Android, it crashes every 2nd day, it's very slow to load info & keeps turning to the wrong page when I click on something.""Downloaded and installed. Could not sign in. Changed password, still \"email or password is incorrect\". Uninstalled.""I literally just created an account and the app keeps saying my email or password is incorrect even after multiple password resets.""I was really enjoying this app. To track all about my little one. But now, I am unable to open the app at all. I reinstalled the app. Same story. Please look into it. Update: It's okay now. And I'm back to loving this app.""I loved it until I had to factory reset my phone and now I can't login. It says wrong e-mail or password. I reset my password 2 times and still can't login.   20/11/2017 I still have this problem. I cannot update my baby milestones, cannot track anything. Email or password incorrect?!?! 12/26/2017... Still problems with logging in. It's been almost 2 months since I cannot use it!!!""I really really like this app! It's great for tracking feedings and diapers and sleeps for my little one ( It feels so weird saying that he's only 10 days old). Anyway, it has lots of great features including the memories tab wjrr ei can save a photo of him each day which really just gives me another reason to take more pictures of him lol. The only thing that would make this any better would be if I could get free samples of stuff like milk storage bags or pampers or Aveeno unscented products (because  free stuff always makes things better) I recommend it to all my friends because it's literally a life saver when my pediatrician asks questions about feedings or wet diapers vs mixed diapers and amounts and yata yata yata... I just whip out my phone open my app and viola I'm super mom. I used the pregnancy plus to track my pregnancy and it was just as amazing. Totally getting my pediatrician to endorse this...""it keeps telling me my password is wrong and I've changed it 5 times""I hate It cause I went on once than the next day I go on my phone I have no more messages contacts and the only app I have left is this one and it says you have to many apps on your device please try again later than I go back on a week later it made my whole phone die and I charged it and it never opened again.""My favorite part of the app is the pictures and the daily information on the pregnancy . I have used it since I found out i was pregnant and I am currently 39 weeks . I just wish it had a community forum or chat. But overall Great app""My wife found this app (she paid for and used the Pregnancy+ app first). I wanted a collaborative app like WebMD Baby and Ovia Parenting where we can log in with our own credentials and track data for one child so that the data is synced. We can even give friends and family read-only access with those apps. However, I like Baby+'s features better and it does what both of those apps do. It's just missing the collaborative capability (therefore it's not \"the most complete Baby App\"). Is this something you will add? Then it gets 5 stars.  Edit: I just had to take off a star because my wife and I lost a whole day's data (feed and nappies) when I added a feed on my phone after she added the earlier feeds. It seems that using the app on two phones confuses it. Please fix.""Good and informative""Great app. But there are problems with syncing on 2 devices having same account.""Love love love this app.. so much fun creating precious memories. Wish I had it for my first born.""Very limited information in the 'development' section. It's only once a month now for my 3 months old baby and just not enough. I make a comparison with the app that we used during the pregnancy.""I've been using this since my daughter was born to log and track feedings and diaper changes. I would have rated 5 stars in the beginning. Not any more. I can't click on anything without it freezing the app up. I have to hit the add button multiple times before it will register I'm hitting it to log anything. I need quick, not slow as molasses. Will probably delete and replace.""I have made an account but every time I try to login it says 'email already in use, try logging in'""App keeps crashing. Uninstalled, reinstalled, made me make a new account (lost my month's worth of data) then crashed before I was finished making my profile. Now it won't open again.""Absolutely love this app and use it to track baby's sleep/eats so I can start to make a schedule. However it just started crashing every time I open it, and it looks like I'm not the only one. Please fix so I can continue tracking, I don't want to uninstall/reinstall and lose 3+ months of data!""The baby feed chart is poor data representation because it implies feeding is quite erratic when actually its just slicing it artificially around midnight. So a big feed at 2330 or 0030 could sway the chart significantly but actually be a negligible difference to baby. I would prefer it did a rolling 24 hour average. Hence I couldn't give five stars. Soz.""it's not letting me set up an account, I was trying to sign in through fb, says email already exists. So then why can't I log in?""I used the app on my previous phone and it helped me greatly, especially with the milestones and the feeding and mapping logs. Unfortunately now I tried to install it on my new phone but it keeps on giving me an error message. The error message is regarding my login details, keeps on telling me the email is already in use.""Helpful app!  My only problem is the constant crashing and sometimes does not log the data right away.  But 100% recommend""I love this baby app. I love the added feature of creating a yearbook and logging memories.""It continuously says that my email or password is incorrect. I've reset the pass a few times but nothing changed... Uninstalling and taking mt money back... I've no time for dealing with this""Unfortunately useless,  it doesn't save the information,  every time I enter the information again until I gave up.""App is too slow and it won't let me update my daughter's birth weight and it also keeps changing her weight""Would have 5 stars if the white noise worked properly. Reported it to the email support people but they still haven't fixed it :(""I absolutely love this app such a great way to keep record. However is it possible to fix one problem, when look back on pre-recorded feeds and sleeps it some times doesn't show them all. I find this to be a problem as i want to look back on day/night feeds to see what i did that made her sleep longer and can not see my recordings. Thanks""After weeks of logging information, every time I try to open the app it restores data and closes it over and over. So all that data lost because the app won't open. Very unhappy since I paid for this damn app. And please don't say it's an unusual issue because ive read the reviews, it is a very common issue.""I changed phone and some of the data are not saved. :-(""Fix it!! The new update keeps unsaving all my data \ud83d\udc94""FURIOUS! after the app not opening I unistalled to reinstall and have lost all my data! Everything! Gone! 15 weeks worth of feeds etc gone. So so angry DO NOT RECOMMEND always crashes and freezes and when you try to fix it deletes everything. &^*$""I have used this and pregnancy plus app. Very useful information""I just downloaded it. Tried logging into it says my email is already used so I tried signing in with it. Wouldn't sign me in. Changed password & says either email or password is wrong. Really?!""Too many bugs for an App that isn't free. I can't add any breast feeding data which is the reason I bought it to track feeding.""I loved the pregnacy+ app..soo exciting reading the daily blogs and seeing all the pics and keeping track of everything befor your babys born... soo i download this one after my new born was here... soo exciting being a first time dad... cart wait to look back on everything thats happend in a years time or soo... 5 stars... thank youu""I mostly liked this app, but all of a sudden after tracking my son's milestones and keeping a diary for months, it won't open. It turns my screen black and won't load anything. So I have lost months of memories and diary entries of my sweet boy. I should've just kept a baby book :(""A lot of issues: I can't update. Face a day doesn't work properly.  Dates don't match baby's correct age.   Otherwise a good app, it has potential, just need to listen to users complaints and correct the issues.  I have emailed support and the response i got was unsatisfactory, basically they offered a refund which says to me that the issues can't be fixed or there is no intention of being fixed. I don't want a refund, i have spent a long time inputting info and this has potential to be a great app.""Can't enter some information and when I reset the app and request a refund, it says it can't be refunded at this time :-( A disappointment, as I liked the pregnancy app.""The same account doesn't refresh on two phones so no use if you were thinking to update data with your partner. Also no reply after a week from developers customer service.""All the features are brilliant ideas if they actually worked half the time. The age they calculate for baby is always wrong. I've informed them of this but they said that's how it's designed which makes no sense because it's wrong!. It says baby is 7 weeks and 1 day when he's 7 weeks on the dot. They also take ages to reply with complaints and concerns. In sort it's as good as useless don't waste your money.""The app looks nice, but is slow to load and too many clicks to get data entered (ie. start and end sleep times). I have used other apps that are faster and easier, but they don't have the fancy interface.  I can live with less flash, and will be using those apps instead. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this one.""All trackers & useful information I need as new parent. Minor problems: (1) baby weight on development guide is still shown in lbs even though I already changed the weight display setting to kg/grams (2) app responds very slowly on clicking milestone trackers icon.""    ""ovulationcalculator.com.ovulationcalculator"":     ""It's very detailed and so informative""Really good. But I seem to keep getting an error message appear now I can't see any of my data""Loved the information it gave everyday! Super helpful!""I really like tracking all my data in one place. The app is user friendly m. The more you use it, the more accurate it gets.""Informative""I really enjoyed reading the articles within the app. Very interesting and informative. I liked being able to chart all of the info and see it graphed out. What really helped me was acupuncture! If you are having issues I highly recommend you give it a shot. It was the only thing that helped get my cycle regulated (I likely wasn't ovulating the 9 months prior after I got off birth control)""Pretty dang accurate. Great facts and helpful information. I'd recommend if just trying to follow a pregnancy or just keep up with your period.""Generally speaking I love this app. It is very informative and educational and I hope it helps us get pregnant. However, a couple of things I would change are: allowing user to enter hours slept and not just bedtime ans wake time. It doesn't allow for anything but full hours, which is rarely going to be accurate. It would also be nice if there were an easier way to log that your period is late.""It seems pretty accurate.  My only issue is that right now it won't let me log in to my account. I've reached out to customer service probably more than 2 times,  and still nothing has been solved""This app is very informative and answers all my questions without me having to google everything.""Very informative""Very informative and helps me keep on top of things. Only had it for a few weeks so no success story yet lol""I LOVE this app but i use a saliva ovulation test kit also....i would give this app 5 stars if i could log the data from the test kit also.""Everytime it was ovulation time, it crashed and wouldn't let me input data! \ud83d\ude21""Works well to keep track of all your data!""Easy to use. Breaks down the information and even tells you the days best to conceive each gender.""It's an easy app. And quite informative. \ud83d\udc4d""Very easy to use. Also very informative. Great on learning how to do certain things to track your cycles.""Love this app!  Has great information that may not be known and tells you when to take your test, when you might be ovulating, it really is the friend you need while trying to conceive!""App is very easy to use and provide valid information on every woman's needs and desires. It's better than Flo which I also use but Flo doesn't give me accurate results and my AF doesn't coincide with OVF""All my information  in one place""Is was the most accurate app I used. I had two app. I decided to do follicles tracking and d same day this app gave was exact DAT the doc gave while d other app was 2 days late. Even though they both had same information""Great app hopefully I will get pregnant soon good graphs and a lot of good information that I didn't know.""I got pregnant after a month of using it to input my daily data, and use of an ovulation kit. Very happy to be pregnant even though I'm massively uncomfortable from the bloat \ud83d\ude0c""Very informative. Could be a little better but gets the job done.""I just got the app not even 8 hours ago and it wants to act up. It's not letting me go in the app. It's giving a message and booting me back out.""I really wanted to love this app. It's beautifully\u200b designed and user-friendly. But beware! If you are trying to log fertility data to share with a provider, this app does not make the cut. Exporting logged data doesn't exist, and exporting/printing your charts doesn't work. You can't even visualize a full cycle in one graphic. Super frustrating after spending so much time logging data. What a waste of time! Still looking for a good app... I'm switching to a homemade solution until then.""Nyc informative""Very informative. I learned so much and I got pregnant within the first month of trying. My last pregnancy took about a year. I am still shocked by how fast this happened thank you very much!""Made all the calculations so simple.  Lots of knowledgeable forums and information on hand.

I dont need gigabytes of snoring sounds on my phone! :)  Added: I need to delete multiple recording files at the time. I dont want to tap and wait for 2 sec for each line! Also there is no way to tell if recording has files or just stats. Just bring the funstion of multiselect back! :(""Really informative. Great""It was working well til this week I start it but it didn't record anything for the past 2 nights. And it confuses doors opening and closing and coughing as grinding.

Now cannot open 'recordings'.""Very helpful data""Excellent information""I like the information that it gives you.""AMAZING APP ALTHOUGH I HAVE DELETED IT NOW AS PICKED UP SOMETHING THAT TERRIFIED ME... SOMETHING OR SOMEONE CLEARLY SHOUTED DIE WHEN I WATCHED BACK..... \ud83d\ude32""The first night, I sounded like a demon. The second night, zero snoring and the one grind it picked up was me closing the door after a middle of the night bathroom break.

Every other app on phone can so not sure what issue is there.otherwise very good. 5 star if it ever finds my wearable""Excellent functionality and information""Other than to a Dr, the app developer, or Google Fit, no way to archive results. Want way to archive to SD card, at least, but prefer to go to PC.""Free app that works, other apps look free but when you try to access the data, it becomes an in-app purchase.   Used more of my memory than I'd like if you keep the recordings but old data can be deleted.  I also like the auto play.  Some apps play one segment, then you have to click the next segment and on a phone it can be tedious.  Overall, the best one I've found.""It's OK.  Big app. It takes a lot of memory. Many misinterpreted \"grinds\" of sounds from moving in bed. Playback is very faint on my MotoG. It would be good to able to export daily sound files to a CSV or similar.""this is so amazing and helpfull app...thank you.....question:can I keep me records  if I will change the mobile phone?...if yes,what I should do for it?""Very informative.""Downgrading : why making it so intrusive in the new update? What's the purpose of tracing my location? Why app developers think that we should share everything with them? Not anymore: Would give extra stars if: a) possible to download or send by email The ENTIRE recording and not having to act on individual - often many- \"few seconds\" recordings b) choice of save directory on an SD card. All in all,  helpful and practical. Certainly can be made better. Especially if owners start ask for money for detachable accessories,  as they do!""Very informative, and easy to use interface.""I'm waiting to see if the data collected can tell me more information about my sleep /snore pattern.   There appears to be a 2 hour gap each night without snoring episodes. Curious! I also recently had surgeries to reduce snoring (turbinate reduction and pillar implants).  The implants take 12 weeks to heal. I'm hoping this app can not only track my progress but also infer why I still snore and if it is getting lighter in duration and intensity.   So far it says I snore about 4% of the night but I don't have anything to compare that to.  Thank you for answering my question! App comes with great support from the developers.""Good app. But moved to SD card to try and save space in my phone. But it still saves files to phone memory. Could probably do with a location setting in app to choose where to save recordings to""It overrides the alarm!!! How is that possile that my snore recording is more important than me waking up early to get to work?!!!  I woke up an hour late! And the funny thing is that the notification bar says, alarm silenced after one minute while it did not work at all! It also said two grinding events and it was wrong. Of course my mobile was slightly higer than my head level and 60 cm away from my head (towars my body) so that is maybe the reason.""Good app which works well with clear recordings. Definitely need an option to save recordings to external SD card. It has also used 1.17Gb of wifi data in the last couple of weeks. What is it doing in the background?... And I've definitely not shared any recordings.""Snoring has become an obsession of mine,i have a custom made mouthguard which works very well,but i accept i will never be completly snore free,your app gives me all the information i need,is easy to understand and use,pleased with the results,""**Edit: New update (also labelled 0.2.1), recording now works. Wish I'd waited.** New update (0.2.1) caused app to crash when pressing recording start. 18 days in a row, no problems. Updates, crashed... So I uninstalled & then reinstalled older version (0.2.0), recorded again but deleted all recordings and statistics rather than leave the folders! So if you attempt to do the same, back up the recordings folder in \"Android/data/com.brux...\" etc.Glad I exported the more interesting/funnier recordings now.""Recorded myself around 11/24-25.  No volume at all when listening to the recording.  Phone volumes were all maxed out.  No sounds played from the app.  Reply 1:  The recordings would not be saved on the phone if there was not enough memory to save them.  (Duh.)  Memory available has nothing to do with sound volumes being absent.  Reply 2: The recording is either saved on the device or it is not.  There is no magical \"not saved\" option to it.  There is no way the app could record someone for hours, show waveforms of activity, be able to upload files of that activity to Dropbox, and yet not exist on the device as you are implying. Update 3:  I can listen to the files just fine on Dropbox.  Dropbox is not the problem.  Listening to my recordings on an alternate source is not going to make the app suddenly start providing sound.  The recording has since been deleted from my phone, since I was able to listen to it on Dropbox.  I may or may not try recording with this app again.  I have yet to decide about that.  If I do, and I do not hear sounds again, I'll look into sending you the recording(s).""I've used it twice now. The first time it said I snored for only a few minutes {partner says otherwise}. The second time it said I didn't snore at all even though I woke myself up snoring a couple of times.

Love the color codes.""Great app for logging blood pressure. Just the right amount of useful features, without unnecessarily-fancy features.  Love how I can enter my data verbally.  For one-time cholesterol and glucose figures, a simple Google search lets me convert my US standard #s to UK standard (mmol/l); no biggie's.  One (minor) thing I still don't quite get is GPS for weather data analysis, as I don't even see it reflected on exported reports.

My doctors nurse preferred a paper record but I didn't need more desk clutter or anything to keep track of. Your app filled my need perfectly. And if they don't want to give you an email, email the report to yourself and take it on your next visit. If it had blue tooth connectivity, my blood pressure monitor would transfer everything. That would be perfect and worth 5 stars.""The app was really good but not quite excellent because of the colour coding. I pointed the developer to recognized Heart and Blood Pressure reference sites for the colour coding and they implemented the suggestions straight away. This is a TOP developer.

I'd rather go to the doctors office early and do paperwork than use this app again.""I love having all of my medical information in one app.  Easily accessible.""This app is NOT user friendly.  Problems signing in.  There are nothing displayed about your visits or test results like MyChart.   This app needs a lot of updating.  It shouldn't be that difficult to get your medical information from an app that is supposed to be \"user friendly\".  I have had nothing but trouble using this app.  Follow MyChart for some ideals on what works and what doesn't work.

What is the point of having it if it does literally nothing? Fix your crap!""I tried this app but could not connect my doctor or hospital. Then I got my doctor in and the data was all screwed up and had MANY duplicates for pills. Finally removed it in disgust. There are far better portals out there and most doctors have their own. I even contacted their tech support and could not get any help there but to reload. Better idea-remove and NEVER put back on. I do not have time for apps that do not work.""Each of my doctors has their own portal, and gathering information is challenging.  After installing, I added the sign on info for two of the portals.  Medfusion immediately grabbed everything from them.  There was more information loaded into Medfusion than I had ever seen in either portal.    My third doctor was not on their list,  so I dropped the developers a note with the doctor's name and address.  Within 24 hours, I got an email telling me that they had been added!  Once I added my sign on info I had all of health info in one place.  On the downside, the formatting of the data pulled from the doctors is still a bit rough, and many of the items have no data inside them.  I'm sure that will improve over time.  I was able to use this to accumulate 2 years of blood sugar test results (7 tests) to show to my doctor.  He only had one in his chart.  Those tests were done at multiple labs ordered by multiple doctors.  It really impressed my doctor, and helped us come up with a treatment plan much quicker.""This app is usless and not worth your time it does not work an not sure how secure it is""I keep getting an error message stating...\"we couldn't connect to medfusion\" so I click retry and nothing!!!

Helps in my profession, as most information is authentic and to date.""Updated information and studies would make it great""This app needs a major overhaul. Too many medications don't have information about how it effects lactation or nursing infants. Update the database!""The information is correct. However it would be extremely helpful to nursing mommies if they understood what the medical mumbo jumbo meant!""Very handy and great, detailed information!""Everything says there's no data available as of the revision date.""I randomly choose different drugs to see the lactation effects it would say no information found. It's a shame they don't take care of the weblinks this could have been a great app. But of course it's a government app they don't care if it works as long as it is there so they have a bulletpoint on there yearly evaluation.""No information found for almost everything""I think this could be a great app, but it's incomplete, doesn't provide some vital info and seems to be copied directly from Wikipedia. Where's Zofran (Ondansatron)? How can Chlorphenimarine not have Cetirazine as an alternate, but has Loratadine & Fexofenadine as alternates, yet Cetirazine has all the others while Fexofenadine has none? Is everything just hand-typed or is the coding & formulas just circa 1974?""Too many times it told me that the data could not be found, even on common prescriptions. What good is this app if I still have to search the Internet for info?""Every drug I searched for (including drugs I knew were safe) said no information available.""Great place to find quality information. Not happy with the constant force close when searching more than one medication.""Not up to date!

I highly recommend getting the premium account for all the flashcards as they were the most accurate I came across in both formatting and difficulty. The questions this app goes through are comparable to the ones on the test and the detailed explanations are stellar.

To use the bolus advisor you need to put in an HCP code that you get from your doctor's office.  My doctor's office did not know anything about it which is really frustrating.  I called Accu-chek myself and was told that they won't give me the HCP code directly because it is like a prescription code.  When I told the doctor's office that they just needed to call to get the code, they STILL haven't gotten it for me 2 weeks later!  I hate depending on the doctor's office for an app on my phone!  I know the bolus amounts for meals, why won't they let me put them in without a silly code?  Also, I am not sure why it doesn't have the ability to put in more than one insulin type at a time.  No pairing problems for me.  Been using it to keep track of my teen, so I feel like I am much more on top of her diabetes without begging her for her involvement.

Data transferred one time. Never again found the meter.""Adding ability to import carb and excercise data from standard apps like Google Fit MFP and Lifesum would be more helpful than food pics. One of the big challenges in tracking is theres a different app for each thing. More ability to customize reports needed. More insulin selections and ability to type in name of meds as well. Why no ability to add more than one type of insulin at a time? Otherwise easy to use albeit needing fine tuning. Seriously just get into the blood pressure monitor biz as well and integrate with Garmin, Fitbit etc for integration.""It works okay on mobile had some issues with the galaxy note 5 connecting to my meter.

I just wish that the data fields were consistent between the Android App and the Accu-Chek Connect online portal. For example, the online portal allows you to input your heart rate into a field designed for this, but there is no such field in the Android app. I use the \"Health State\" field in the app to record my pulse and then, out of necessity, manually transfer the data to the \"Heart Rate (Pulse)\" field in the portal. Further, why provide data fields for systolic and diastolic BP in the app but not a data field for pulse? This makes no sense. Bottom line: The data fields in the app and portal need to be consistent, so that all data transfers completely and uniformly?""I'm still waiting for email. How long it takes""It's a great idea.  I like my Accu-Chek connect meter, and when the app works it is very handy.  However, my meter loses bluetooth connection to my phone about once a week and I have to re-pair it.  I'm not sure if it's a problem with the app, my phone, or my meter, but I don't have issues with any other bluetooth devices on my phone.  Also, I can not get the Send to Online Account feature to work.  I previously had an old version of the app (which wasn't officially supported on my Nexus 6P, so I couldn't download from google play, but worked fine when I downloaded the apk) and the online account worked fine.  Ever since updating to the newer version of the app though, it says \"There was an issue connecting to your online account.  Please try again later\".  I am using the correct credentials, because if it still tells me if I change them and enter them wrong.""I absolutely LOVE this app. As a mother of a diabetic it simplifies the process of gathering,  monitoring and phoning in blood sugars to the doc. I am having one problem though. I have twins, both diabetic. At this point i can only use this app with 1 child. Logging out/in as a new user doesnt clear previous users data. Is there a work around for this. I would really love to use it for both kids!""I will not go on with this. I will not be picking up my meter even though it is free with coupon. I had to stop on the account set up because of the birthday entry.

Remiders not working at all at any level. 90 day results is better than 30 and more useful. the 30 day limit is not the best.  seems like the app was written by non diabetics they should understand these fixes.""Swiping it away in the task manager then attempting a restart of the app usually works, even if it takes a few times. Unfortunately the constant crashes render the auto-send feature useless. At least I can still manually trigger a data send and when the app is running it functions as intended.""Wont accept 13 character alpha numeric password. Wasted half hr! No contact info.

SmartSwitch however moved it anyway. Works great on Note 7, however will not restore data from Note 4 with Accu-Chek backup/restore, so must still use Note 4 until Note 7 is officially approved.  S7 is basically identical to Note 7 but no Stylus. - Roche, get with it! and put Note 7 on the list. It is compatible!""The app is ok. It does ok with data reccording, but is pretty simplistic.

I've tried every format for a date I can think of, I don't know what they're looking for.  Their office is closed until tomorrow.  Why is my birth date required to give me a reading, anyway?

My Accu Chek Aviva Connect meter wirelessly sent my meter data to my phone and computer. Then it stopped and I am unable to get it to pair the with the Bluetooth on my phone.  I callled Roche tech support and got excellent advice, which solved my problem.""Deleted my previous review by accident. Simply stated, pairing is still broken. When I attempt to pair with my Note 5 running 6.0.1, the text input box on the app won't allow me to enter text. The cursor is there, but the input box isn't responsive.  Roche responded.

In a relatively short period of time I've had to uninstall/reinstall, delete the device from my online account, re-login, re-pair. All the while losing my custom notes. Good thing I'm not relying on this thing to give me bolus advice or I'd be SOL.

While the glucometer already allows you to tag pre- and post-meal readings, the level of detail that you can document in the app is much more extensive. You can track your meal (by size, by carbs or by calories), the amount of insulin injected, the duration and intensity of workouts, energy level, blood pressure, weight and even a photo of your meal. This is an indispensable record that I'm looking forward to sharing with my endocrinologist. I do have two primary reservations at the moment. The first is the lack of support for non-Samsung phones. The other, is that you can only enter one insulin injection per reading. There are occasions when I take both a separate basal and bolus shot at the same time. This app does not let me log both shots, which renders my injection data flawed. Please allow multiple injections to be documented on one reading in a future release.""Great concept, but not near enough device support. HTC, LG, and Moto devices aren't listed for download.

Yes, normally you would have them listed in your phone, but what if your list gets whipped out by an update? This happened to me and it causes frustrating to have to input.

Unlike them, it is versed in spelling variants and only rarely does not locate a particular term. I've been happy to find more obscure terms for my specialized field of study of radiology in addition to anatomy, pharmacology, etc. This 5-star app could be further enhanced by an ability to easily sort bookmarks into folders or even sub-folders (Oxford's approach is too monotonous to really use). The developer is responsive and seems to care when issues may arise.""Great, informative app!""Slow.""There is no offline mode...or rather a detective and incomplete offline database is downloaded when u switch over to offline In short Cant download the dictionary data offline""I love this app. It's very informative.

I used to love the app for tracking bbt but now with the update I'm not able to access past charts or days for data entry.""New update is giving me a blank screen on individual cycle days so I am unable to add any data.""New update changed the app, and now it won't load my daily input section to add data (temps, etc)! Please fix it.""While I absolutely love this app, there is definitely room for improvement. Kindara seems to favor the iOS version, so Android users don't have a vaginal sensation section, which would be really nice to have. Also, swiping through each day in the data part is not a smooth transitition. Sometimes I have to swipe several times before it changes days. Also, I'd like to be able to share my chart with others properly instead of doing \"share chart with community\" and then doing a screen shot. Lastly, the coverline usually takes me a few tries for it to appear. All in all, it's a very asthetically pleasing app and I have loved every minute of the journey I have began with FAM and Kindara (I'm on my second cycle).""There is room for improvement.  Things I like: I like the aesthetics much better than Fertility Friend. I also like the custom fields option and the ability to hide items that I do not normally track. In this respect I find Kindara a lot cleaner than other similar apps.  Things I don't like: I do not like the inverse representation of CM levels on the graph (higher bar for lower CM).  There needs to be a forward and reverse arrow on the data entry page for easy navigation between days. I am not a fan of having to swipe repeatedly to navigate  to a certain date. Similar arrows should also be present on the charts page for easy navigation between cycles.  There should be a homing button that will bring you to today's date from whatever date you are currently looking at. The app currently does not have a feature where you can compare several cycles side by side on the same page.""I really like this app. I used ovagraph and found it terribly clunky and slow. Kindara is easy to use and looks great. I use the FAM method of birth control, and have found understanding your body is key to using Kindara. In my opinion you won't learn FAM properly from this app. But once you understand the principles of fertility awareness, Kindara is a great tool.""I've just come from an Apple device and i cannot believe how woeful Android Kindara is. It's buggy and lacklustre. I can barely input any information and ive spent far too long attempting.   Its sad, because i really loved this app on my iPhone, but this is just disappointing.""It was a trick. It wants me to buy the product. It's a bit informative but not actually helpful.""It used to work perfectly but now it's super slow and never loads""I've been using Kindara for years and I love it! I buy ovulation test strips online and in conjunction with Kindara's ability to keep track of all biological data, I know exactly when I'm ovulating and when I'm not. Thanks so much for a great app!!""I absolutely LOVE this app! Kindara is great for tracking fertility! I've been using it for 2 years now, in conjunction with Fertility Awareness. I love that they've added a coverline! It used to be that you could only use the coverline feature on the website. Other features that I love include being able to add custom data, the most detailed cervix tracking (that I've seen based on trying out other apps), and how easy it is to read and interpret my chart on my own.  For people who are giving this app negative reviews based on predictions, no app will be able to accurately predict a woman's period, unless it arrives like clockwork every single time. Most women do NOT have clockwork cycles. The best way to use this app is by utilizing both basal body temp and cervical fluid features together, and interpreting your chart with the guidance of a FAM instructor, the awesome book- \"Taking Charge of Your Fertility\", and/or a FAM support group especially in the beginning and when having trouble interpreting your charts on your own. Do not rely on predictions from ANY app. Listen to what your body is telling you instead. This app will help you do that! \ud83d\ude09""Customer service was helpful by sending out a replacement Wink when my original was having trouble syncing. It synced one time and entered the temperature with an incorrect time and date. Even with a new Wink though, the app would not sync, which turns into a really expensive digital thermometer that is not especially convenient. The app was working fine for charting my cycles. The \"Expected Period\" dates have never been accurate, but my cycle is irregular. This cycle, I had an issue with a cycle starting on the first day but the second day of my period is recording as the first day of a different cycle. Unselecting/deleting the data as recommended does not fix the problem, even after closing out and restarting the app. I am looking into switching over to a different app that is hopefully less problematic.""I love this app! It has everything I need for charting plus the community is great. However I think the design is a little bit weird- I wish the CF would rise and fall, more like a normal chart where the hormones spike at ovulation, instead of making a dip and going back up as your fertility goes down. It just seems a little backwards to me.""The swipe feature of the app is slow and sometimes doesn't work, which is very frustrating. This causes me to not want to use the app for days at a time, I'd rather use a pen and paper. I also have a Wink which only syncs to the app when the app is open on my phone. Occasionally it misses a day when syncing and recently I lost 13 days of data that is unrecoverable.""I am unable to \"Enter Kindara\" at the end of the tutorial because the circle page indicators at the bottom of the page actually sit on top of the \"Enter Kindara\" button. Every time I try to touch the button it takes me back into the tutorial. I have not been able to enter the app. I am using a smaller screen Alcatel. Clicking the links within the tutorial take me to the Knowledge Base but not into the app itself. Is there a way to bypass the tutorial?""Amazing resource for anyone trying to avoid pregnancy under the current political administration, especially when we don't know if our right to choose will be taken away tomorrow! Very empowering, super informative Knowledge Base, very responsive assistance team for any app-related glitches that arise.""The problem I have with this app is that the Android version is a little too different from the iOS version and not completely in a good way. On iPhone I was able to see my period/fertile day predictions on the actual chart but not on Android?? Are y'all serious? That's a basic necessity that should be on both versions. Also the landscape viewing is annoying because instead of seeing everything in one screen, I have to scroll over and the exporting my chart as an image option doesn't seem to be there like it was on iOS. Also scrolling between days is difficult. It almost doesn't let me do it without excessive dragging and it's annoying. It makes looking back at past charts hard for no reason. I enjoy this app for tracking purposes but it's a real shame that y'all are just leaving Android users behind like that. Please update so that everyone is on the same page...We shouldn't be missing out on basic features...I hope y'all are having a beta for Android users because I sure would sign up!""This app is way more glitchy than the iPhone version. And I used to be able to chart even without wifi nor data, and I can't even open it on here without it. It's been making it difficult to stick to charting everyday as a result.""New to charting and this app is very easy to use. There's a huge section that has information on FAM and tracking your cycle if you're a beginner or just need refreshing. You can also share you chart with fellow users and everyone is really helpful. It has created such a community of women. It's amazing.""So wanted this have memory issues""Full of great information. The Wink is fantastic. Works great. Really easy to chart.Thank you Kindara.""I really love this app it was the first one I saw with information about charting and learned so much about it. I Feel powerful and in control of my body \ud83d\ude0d""Same comment as most reviewers - if you use an iOS device you'll love it, if you use Android - UX is compromised and Wink probably won't work!   Wink won't pair with A LOT of Android devices. While it's not Kindara's fault that Android's newer versions don't comprehensively support BLE, it is NOT COOL that Kindara don't write this as a disclaimer anywhere on the Wink purchase page. It is in the FAQs but you'd think that given the majority of smartphone owners own Android's and more people everyday are moving from Apple to Android devices, that Android users would be treated better as a use case when it comes to the Wink.   I basically bought the Wink and no where through the purchase process did it say that Android Nougat may not be supported. I receive Wink and it didn't work at all. Was told to try testing with family members iOS devices - still didn't work. Then once it was clear it was faulty I was told I had to pay to ship it back under warranty (I know - not cool right?). I said there was no way I'd pay $25 for shipping a faulty device so they paid half in the end. New Wink still won't pair with my phone and will only work with my / boyfriends iPad.   Recommendations:  1) include product specifications on the Wink purchase page and be clear about which devices / OS versions are definitely supported. After all you've written this in the FAQ page, so shouldn't have a problem putting it on the purchase page too.   2) if you still want Android users to give Wink a go but are unsure if their device will be supported, offer a 30 day return policy - and make sure you cover return shipping! After all you can already tell which app and version they're using so you'll know that they're being genuine. And if you're not willing to do this then please just go with recommendation 1!""Kindara is by far my favourite tracking app as out of all the apps I've tried its the most focused on using FAM for contraception. I love looking at everyones charts, the community aspect and the educational section is informative for those learning the method. Over the years of using kindara I enjoyed using it despite some of the small glitches that would annoy me and affected the ease of use, such a it refreshing when you've written a reply or caption and having to write it out again about 5 times! Or not allowing me to unfollow a chart and it staying in my followed charts for months. However, recently it's become even more glitchy eg. When I've completed a chart for some reason it breaks it up and creates a small 3-4 day chart out of the last days of my one chart. I also recently updated to the new app and definitely prefer the old app. I now can't tap anywhere on the day I want to go into and edit, I have to click the small section at the top. On the section where I put in my info for the day, it doesn't let me completely scroll the bottom and cuts off the bit to \"add custom\". The worse thing about the new app is that I can't just scroll through my feed to check out people's charts. The charts don't show, so I have to click onto where the chart should be then the chart shows but I have to go into everyone's post to look at the chart then come out again back to my feed. Which kind of ruins the community aspect as I've stopped bothering to look on my feed. However, I love the app and been charting with it for two years! Hope this is all due to the new app and that these glitches will be smoothed out soon!""I like the simplicity of Kindara, you can add only symptoms that actual mean something to yourself, and it doesn't have any food data like Ovia, which I like. One thing I wish it had, was the time of temp taken, and if the time wasn't within your normal temp time, the plotted dot on your chart should be a empty circle, not a solid circle like when you taken it on time. That would be VERY helpful. I use Fertility Friend app still because no other app has there feature. I can't wait to go down from 4 apps to 1 some day. I hope Kindara will be that app. But not sure yet.""Changing my review to 4 stars. The information commented below is correct. After closing and reinstalling the app... it still appeared on the \"Create Account\" screen to put in the info for my name and passwords creations.   I hit back to clock the app like it does all other son my phone, and it went back several steps to the proper screen mentioned in the comments.   So the app is amazing. Just remember that when you change devices, hit the back button a few times if you already have an account""I used to love this app but the Iphone version is so much better than the droid version (no, not an apple fan). First, I couldnt login and it was giving me so many errors. Their customer service was GREAT!!! I would give them 5 stars or more. However, when it comes to the apps, they perform differently though they have the same account. Perform so differently that fertile windows are off by 3 whole days!!!  This is not good for people who are avoiding pregnancy or who are trying to get pregnant. The expected period date was the same, but the fertile windows were different.  Oh, and reverse logic. If you choose \"avoiding pregnantcy\" as goal, fertile window drops on mine. Counter intuitive. If i want to avoid pregnancy, I actually DO want to see the fertile windows to help with avoiding and also to see if they are matching the OPK.   Then, the fertile windows, etc., disappears for the prior month. On the iphone version, all that data is still there. Kindara was the only accurate Ovulation predictor for me that I had found when comparing and using other apps. Now, I am extremely nervous and have to carry around my other phone just to make sure I am aligned.""I've mailed support to solve this issue. So far, I've tried to uninstall and reinstall, delete the app data, but nothing seems to work. I'm going to try and install it on my boyfriend's phone and see if it works. Hopefully I haven't just wasted 200\u20ac when I already had a cheap BBT termometer lying around.""I researched a bunch of fertility trackers and choose this one because of the founders' story. Unfortunately, it looks like they took their iPhone version and hacked it up to *sort of* run on Android devices. It only saves some of the data I put in, the borders of the entry fields are sometimes hidden below the toolbar and therefore unavailable, and the only way to restart the app is to kill it in Settings or restart the phone. If I'm ever interested in an iPhone, I would try this again.""I agree that this isn't up to par for android users yet.  I have an s7,  & there are so many things android users can't do.   The app wouldn't even let me edit my email or username, which are the most basic functions any app should have.  Customer support button doesn't work on app, so I had to use my computer to get in contact, but they did respond quickly.  Im having issues everyday getting my wink to sync.  I would love to love this app.  This is a new product so hopefully the bugs will be fixed soon.""Hi, I was wondering if I could get some help. Halfway through my cycle when inputing CF it just stays grey on my chart, ive logged out and back in. Ive uninstalled the app and loaded it back up nd nothing is helping. In the calander it shows up pink but only grey on my chart no matter what i try...was loving this app but now my chart is unclear. How do I fix this? Please help.""I pre-ordered their WINK by Kindara item so long ago I don't even remember. I keep emailing support to return my money as I no longer need or want this item, they keep emailing me that it is on its way. There are no telephone numbers to call and speak to someone, everything is handled by helpless emails back and fourth, and most of the links on their website DO NOT WORK. The app has an option to call for support, but the link on this button does not work either. This is a scam. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.""Can no longer pdf and email to myself to print or share. It's really frustrating because I need it for my doctor visits. Tracking is excellent in this app. But pointless if I can't share. I have a Samsung Galaxy s7 - android app""The login button is unresponsive after I enter my username and password. I reset them just in case but it only got me as far as the login page and then still got stuck. Please fix""I've used a few tracker apps and this one seems decent, and doesn't steal data from my phone which is awesome. I wish it would allow for a more complete spectrum of fertility rather than exclusively menstruation. I wish it included abortion, pregnancy, miscarriage as standard options. That would make it more useful.""The android app is slow, buggy, and looks like it was made ten years ago. I use it because it's the most versatile app you can get for free, but I liked it so much better on ios.""Can you please add a \"save\" button to each daily entry so that I feel like I'm not losing info that I put in. Let me enter my info, press save, and it takes me back to the monthly calendar screen. TIA""I can't change my email address and can't delete the account. That's ridiculous.""Great app but I hate that I can't change my age as I mistakenly selected the wrong year and other profile information, also I don't seem to get any notifications on the cycles I folllow on my android .""I loved this app before my phone was stolen and had trouble logging back on. Very prompt service-thank you!   I've looked at and tried other apps. This is the best: easy to navigate, I love that I can set what info is collected.""I love the idea of this app and was really excited to use it! But when I go to create an account it says invalid already used, which its not I'm a brand new user. So than I go to the login screen to request a password reset, that worked. So I go in to login with the password I just reset it too and won't load. Please fix!!""I never used this before and wont let me make an account because it says its already made. What??""I've tried every email I have and it tells me they all have accounts and this is not true.""Can't log in, can't create a new account as all my email \"already exists\" Annoying. Please fix.""PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS!  Many women in a  group I belong in are all having issues with this app where we cannot create an account.""I was having problems with the app, it had the start of a new cycle even though my current cycle wasn't over. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and now it is saying I have the incorrect email and password (even though I'm sure it's correct because I just used it to log in on a different device)""I updated the app and now I'm not able to sign in, when I try this tells me my username or password is not valid, which is not true since I can still access my account from website. Fix this issue soon please.""I got a new phone and now I can't log in. It says my email and password combo isn't right,  so I click on \"forgot password\" and it tells me I have an invalid email, but then when I try to sign up, it says there's already am account using my email. Help, I need my chart back soon!""Seems ok, quicker to log than other apps. But it doesn't seem to show fertile window in tta mode. Erases your missed period instead of moving it back. Also, like most health forums, prepare to be lectured by strangers who think they know more about your body than you do.""This app makes charting SO much nicer. I love everything about it and I LOVE their team! Every time I email them they have a solution and are constantly working on making the app better and better. I love Kindara.""Thank-you so much for making this app!!! It's so practical and informative, it's wonderful not to have to be in the pill!!""I've been using Kindara for about 2 years now, and I love it! After my second child I decided not to go back on birth control and started researching FAM, which introduced me to Kindara. I quickly realized I knew nothing about my body, and Kindara has really helped me figure things out. I've gotten to the point where I know my signs of ovulation and probably wouldn't need to take my temperature, but continue because it's habit. Thank you Kindara!""I tried to enter the info I have on my past cycle. After entering some data, I realised that I had accidentally put the wrong cycle start date (11th vs 12th) No biggie, I thought, and went back and edited the info. Then, when I looked at the \"cycles\" overview, I saw that the app had created 2 cycles, starting 1 day apart! There's nowhere to delete the information and start again. So I reset the app and cleared the cache, tried to set up again only to find that there's no login, only a new account set up!""I love the tracking versatility but the app won't let me post in the community and I can't even find any of my shared posts for the last 3 days. I email support but no one answers. I also wish the app gave out more insights and cycle interpretations like ovia and ff.""I loved this when I first downloaded it. Now, it is slow, glitchy and the cycles don't input properly. It's super frustrating.""Would love to see more entered data at a glance, along with option to have set number of days filled in when period start is entered.""Kindara is beautiful and functional - It was the beginning of June 2015 when I heard that a company was working on a thermometer that would sync with your phone to chart your temperatures. I was intrigued, and when I installed the app on my phone I determined to preorder a wink right away! I began using Kindara as my main chart and became involved in the thriving community. I converted one of my real life friends to Kindara as she was just learning to chart, and she loves it as well. The ability to follow a chart makes it so easy to mentor those who have questions or concerns about their cycle, and my friend and I have enjoyed using both the browser version and the app to share data and support each other!  In summary, Kindara has been a reliable app to track my fertility and to build community with others doing the same. I have not found an app that is as beautiful and functional as Kindara, nor one that has a community to easily converse with about charting. I look forward to the arrival of my Wink, and I am convinced that Kindara will continue to support women in Fertility Awareness for many years to come!""I have the worst memory, and I need to keep track of my cycle (which after my tubal are beyond unpredictable) perfect app for me!""It actually worked, but no. I went through the set up and got to the Create Account part. When I clicked the button to create my account... nothing happened. I can see the button being depressed, but no action by the app followed. I re-installed it again and tried again with the same result.""I really want to use this app but it won't let me set up an account. It just keeps saying server error. Please fix!""I can't even get started. It won't connect to server. I enter my email and password to set it up and I get the \"error communicating with server\".""I loved this app on my iPhone but when I switched to an android OS, the app did nothing but crash. I'm not even running any other apps, but it just keeps crashing. I'll be back when they fix it! It's a great way to visualize your cycle... when it works!""I enjoy this app. It's very flexible, informational, and overall a really great app to use to learn how your body works and how you can truly take control of your own reproductive health!""I have horrible side effects from birth control & have been off of them for three years. It was risky business, with plenty of pregnancy scares, until I found this app and method of birth control. I have been using it for ten months now & couldn't be happier. I am now once again in control of my fertility and my husband loves the fact that I  have infertile days and he can go \"au natural\". The app itself works seamlessly, is easy to understand, and has great support pages to help learn how to track. A+++""I use this app for period tracking. The following items would make this the perfect app for my needs: 1) Don't erase the \"expected period\" dates if I go past them. 2) Allow me to put in my cycle time (or better yet, learn it from the data I've given you already!). Everyone isn't 28 days. (EDITED: Turns out it's predicting just fine--my body is just wonky and unpredictable.) 3) Alerts! I'd love to choose to be alerted 2 days before expected period and 2 days after, just in case I'm late or forgot to log it.""Feel so empowered...and love the information and especially the light hearted humour makes it easier to digest the information of an otherwise sticky topic""FF actually helps you take the guesswork out of ovulation day and helps you know when you are most fertile. I will admit, it has great information about cervical position but mostly it's do it yourself.""So easy to use and allows you to enter a lot of detailed information. I've been using this app for 3 years and in my opinion it is still the best one out there for keeping track of fertility.""I have experience with many fertility awareness methods and this app does a great job of being used friendly for many different methods. I appreciate the way you can edit it to add your own observations. I also love how you can send to anyone via email. Love it and would recommend to anybody.""I am nearly 30 with two children and when I started natural planning, I had no idea about the fertility awareness method. I had been on hbc for six years. I always thought there has to be a better way! When i found it, I couldn't believe what my GYN and regular anatomy classes never told me. As a woman, this has helped me understand that our bodies have all the information we will ever need. I hope that women everywhere are taught this. I will pass this lesson to my two daughters when they are of age!""Easy to read, pretty format, and customizable. Their help department is fantastic as well. I had a problem and they got back to me with a fix within hours. Great app, great company!""Still learning the ropes but this app has really helped with its information base.""For years I have used the app My Days. I always assumed that I was ovulating on the date that was highlighted. When my phone went on the fritz I lost all of my data and decided to switch apps. I have been using kindara for 3 months now and just found out through tracking and ovulation predictor kits that I am not ovulating. This app gave me the data to help me discuss my issue with my doctor. Hopefully, with a little help from the doctor and tracking with Kindara, I will be getting pregnant soon.""Very easy to input information and the chart is easy to read. The kindara community is so helpful and encouraging. Great app!""I'm unable to send email @ feedback & feature request. It says delivery failed. Could it be possible that the app gets more modern look or material design? Also can emotions & more symptoms be added? And an video showing how to utilize the\u00a0 app properly and fully would be great.\u00a0""The app is good but can not back up data.""Don't let you set an account""The best part about this app is the community. Multiple ways to view your cycle information and the interface is clean + easy to use. Appreciate the cross compatibility with my phone (Android) and my iPad. Can't wait for my Wink!""Beautiful app, intuitive data input.""I love having a community of support who understands and gives advice. Also great for keeping track of your cycle information. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I do!""I have tried other apps like period tracker and they really don't compare. Kindara is easy to use and the support is awesome, I had an issue, sent them an email and got a response quickly and my issue was resolved!""I love this app, I've been using FAM (fertility awareness method) and this app is the best one I've used. The Kindara staff are quick to reply if you have a feature request or a problem. The community feature is great with lots of helpful people. Customizable data entry. Just lots of awesome features and the app has a beautiful clean look.""Love the  app but a shame you can't message ppl directly  also have sent a email for help and no reply just yet xx""Easy to use well designed and informative""Best fertility app I've tried you can track everything you want and get lots of helpful information.""I started charting my cycles a few years ago to avoid pregnancy when I went off the pill. Now, after having a (planned) child, I am getting back in the swing of charting and LOVE this app compared to pen and paper. It is convenient and visually appealing and I have been raving about it to everyone. Whether you want to achieve or avoid pregnancy, learning to chart your fertility is so empowering and this app is a great tool with awesome support staff :) FYI there is a cervix tracking option you can turn on.""The best fertility app out there, period. No pun intended ;) seriously, it's the only one you need. The social community is awesome. So much helpful information.""I went to use the app as I do every morning and it signed me out.

The first suggestion was a few drops of apple cider vinegar with honey in a cup of hot water in the morning. I tested this for five days straight, and my BP is now back in the low 120's.
